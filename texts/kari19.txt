Knitting. I have chicken korma over aloo gobi for lunch. Tired. Fuck colposcopies, and fuck the dreams my pristiq gives me. Jon is still wonderful and will eventually get this scarf I am knitting. iPhone isn't that bad to type on but it's not great either. I am really tired again lately. Back to sleep.
