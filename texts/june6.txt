So I started off to write a narrative of our trip to Memphis, but just got overwhelmed by the length of it all. So, instead, I'm going to do bullet highlights.  Huh...it's sort of a discipline to condense :) Good training. (I've been reading about and thinking about spiritual disciplines :) Haha for a change in pace and to entertain myself, I'll even categorize them... :)

The Participants
•	Joe: beloved spouse, resident techno-geek (in a good way!), and probably the funniest of us all
•	Erin: our pastor's wife, my weekly breakfast buddy, and bearer of a new tattoo (vines to symbolize the connecteness of us all)
•	Rachael: everyone's friend, dog lover, and kind hearted soul
•	Kayla: Erin's best friend, newlywed, sharp wit
•	Alex: Tech/UCM student, former marine, persistent thinker
•	Me: um? not sure I can write about myself....I'm a dork. Ha. 
The Trip There
•	Rachael and I drove separately to Sioux Falls, where we joined the others at 3am. I slept the entire way there :(
•	Took the scenic route through the Ozarks, and ate one meal at Peggy's cafe...the middle of nowhere Missouri. Great gooseberry pie, though. I haven't head that in years ;)
•	Spent time listening to each person's mix CD, worship tunes, and some local Memphis radio. 
•	Conversations, drivers, and sleepers rotated through the car :) Come to think of it, I never once drove....
The First Night
•	We illegally fit six in a four-person suite. The boys are on the floor (or "the basement" as it is lovingly referred to)
•	Ryan, our pastor and Erin's husband, has some seminary buddies in Memphis. We met them for famous Corky's BBQ and then afterwards to Salsa, the bar we would make our home over the next few nights. The bartender, Ben, is a wise man and makes a mean Washington Apple shot.
•	One of the seminary buddies, Steve, is now renamed Christopher. (we decided that it fit, and in any case is better than "Evil Yoda" as he is called in seminary). He is our gracious host, tour and life guide. We are all instantly connected with him and continually pick his brain for all sorts of ideas.
•	Rachael is now named Samantha (long story). And she snores a bit. hee hee. We love her.
Okay. As much as I would love to keep writing...I'm exhausted and have breakfast in about 6 hours. I'll pick up where I left off soon.....with The Conference. Hee hee.

~grace & peace~
