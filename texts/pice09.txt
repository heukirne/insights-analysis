Give me a reason not to keep sleeping
When I'm awake I feel like I am dreaming
The world is shrinking, every street's the same thing
I can reach so far but there are people disappearing.

How can I pretend to know my own mind?
The more questions I ask, the more I find.
I'm lost at home, out of time
The coins I flip land on their side

I'm holding my breath at your end of town
I'm just passing by, not for the first time.
If I could rest my head just for a moment
Then I think that I would be fine.

Slowly sinking, still thinking
There must be something I am missing.
The streetlight, my sunlight
I won't sleep, I'm up all night.

Can't stop till I have been used up
If I was not lost for words
then I'd have nothing to describe

These walls all seem like they're shrinking
How am I fine, when I can't tell what I'm thinking.
The doctor says it's all in my mind.
But I am afraid of the darkness I might find.

So take on a side, look for a sign
I'm shaking outside, and breaking design.
I'm holding it tight.
Praying I'm right.

I'm holding my breath at your end of town
I'm just passing by, not for the first time

Slowly sinking, still thinking

I won't sleep I'm up all night.

Can't stop till i have been used up
If I was not lost for words
then I'd have nothing to describe

I'm holding my breath at your end of town
I'm just passing by... Not for the first time
If I could rest my head just for a moment
Then I think... I would be just fine.

Repeat 2x to fade out.
