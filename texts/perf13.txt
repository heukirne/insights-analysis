The weather is supposed to be cool-ish and clear, so I think today is my "long walk day." I'll walk up the boulevard all the way to Hope St., head down Hope to Brown University and turn right down Waterman, back home. It's 5.3 miles, which is not LONG, long - but good enough.

I am loving my new ipod that doesn't crap out at 40 minutes or turn itself off when it gets jostled. AND it has a lovely little feature, especially for listening to audiobooks: if the headphone cord gets accidentally pulled out, it pauses. YAY for good design!

Once again, I am up around 5 am for no discernible reason.
