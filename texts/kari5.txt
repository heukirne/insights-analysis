I have made food for him for a picnic.
He has cooked me delicious food.
We have made dinner together.

How did I know with no doubts whatsoever that I loved him? I showed him that my nose is crooked, he smiled and said it is, kissed it and said he loved it. 

Started working in inventory at work, and at the moment this involves doing physical inventory. I like it.
