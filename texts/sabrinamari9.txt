Sometimes I find myself using tarot as a quick fix---not the best way to use it.

But every once in awhile I need to ask a question that I'm just praying isn't what I fear. So grateful that tonight's answer lets me keep some good memories without having to throw them out.

So very grateful that what I thought was woven in good faith actually was.
