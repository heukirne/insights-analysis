ric and I checked out Neutaconkanut Park, which is a tiny bit of wilderness tucked inside the city limits of Providence. It's a wooded lot that includes the highest point in the city - wonderful views of downtown, Brown U, the armory... I took a few more house pics, but not as many as I would have, had I been on my own.

Then we took a short hike in Arcadia state park. We saw HUNDREDS and hundreds of jacks-in-the-pulpit, violets lining the edges of a creek, moss-covered stone walls, a large tree snail and possibly some lady-slipper foliage (no blooms).

We stopped by a junk shop on the way home, but it was closed. It's just as well, since we ended up glued to the radio (This American Life) for twenty minutes while sitting in the parked car.

Now we've landed briefly at home before we head off to the cheap, second-run theatre and then a late supper at La Laiterie.
