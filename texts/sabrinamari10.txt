One more thing: although I never believed I would be driving to Maryland anywhere near this much, the classes are worth it. Today's was wonderful, and I'm beginning to enjoy more and more of my classmates.

I think I could drive there in my sleep now. I don't even think of three hours as a long drive anymore. Six hours in one day? Sure. Spread over a weekend? That's a vacation. I mean, after solo jaunts to Oklahoma, it's like a trip downtown.
