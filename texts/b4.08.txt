Ya know, I often wish that I read more science fiction. This sounds ridiculous and you are probably wondering why I don’t just read more science fiction, instead of wishing that I did. 
 
(Some old trappers from the Fort just left the bar…surreal)
 
Anyway, as I was typing…
 
I’ve come across a lot of science fiction that is good but also a lot that is loosely disguised smut. I used to say that Sci-Fi was the romance novels for males. The major difference being there are at least a few light bulbs still on in that genre. 
 
I used to like “Outer Limits” and, of course “The X Files” but I don’t know if those count as sci-fi. I’m also not overly excited by the thought of giant ants that suck brains from mars. 
 
I think the problem is that I perceive it as a male dominated genre with dominantly male focus; you know, like porn. As such, I am a little intimidated by the subject.
