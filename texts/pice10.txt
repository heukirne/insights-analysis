I wish i were but a little stronger.
I wish I were but a little taller.
I wish my eyes were but a little better.
I beg for even a little longer.

But if I were a little stronger, taller, better, and had longer.
I would not be me, not the slightest,
not even close, no not I, would I be,
not even close to me.

I wouldn't be.

... there's a moral to this story, and I will get to it when I realize what it is...
