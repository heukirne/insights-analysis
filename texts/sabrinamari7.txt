Tonight I took Trent to a film screening and talk focusing on the Lost Boys of the Sudan.

Until this evening, I didn't know that in 1987, a war between the Arabs of northern Sudan and the African Christians of southern Sudan forced thousands of male children from the ages of 4-14 into the bush, where they fled to escape being shot.  They had no food, relatives, or adults of any kind to help them.

I did not know that the older boys took charge of caring for the little ones as they walked in groups from the Sudan to Ethiopia and then ultimately to Kenya, facing starvation, thirst, and disease.  I didn't know they lived in Kenyan refugee camps for many years until a few were resettled into countries like the United States.

Neither did Trent.

We also listened to Nathaniel Chol Nyuk tell us how he and his friends survived the trek.

I have never felt so lucky to love and be loved in my life.  I have been given Trent and Michael to love, and many beloved friends besides.  We are healthy, happy and together.  We are kind to each other, we laugh every day, and we return each other's love with endless abundance.  I am so incredibly fortunate.
