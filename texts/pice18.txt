Lucid dreams and untapped realities
A hunters orgasm chasing the artificial Hare.
In absentia provided the lure of the hunt.
A sacrilegious offering of forbidden Mare.

For as long I remember, endless and eternal.
The Rabbit's chase, divine Mare's embrace
Her beating heart inevitably dying away
Why just couldn't she have stayed?

If the fare is fair, then why does it hurt?
Over and over repeated in my head
Perpetuating the cycle and so life is
and always will be spinning out of control.

Endless and eternal
Like chasing rabbits
through a wild fire
Forever
