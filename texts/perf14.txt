Have I really achieved equilibrium? I think I've only managed this kind of balance once or twice in my life.

I started the day with exercise and fresh air: a five plus mile walk.
Then I alternated time in the studio with household chores.
Got fourteen items on my twenty-item to-do list DONE: worked on two different batches of houses at different stages of production, paid all our bills, packed up a return, folded a load of laundry, returned emails, made dinner plans with one friend and walking plans with another, gathered up books to donate to the library book sale, washed dishes, ate a healthy dinner and sat down to enjoy the feeling of a productive day!

Weeeeeeird....!!!!
