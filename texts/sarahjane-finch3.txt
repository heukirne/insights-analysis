I woke up this morning with the lingering memory of a dream, it was my real farther giving me a cup cake as a way of apologizing for his abuse and abandoning me at seven.

As I came around sudden rushes of images from a trip I had came into my mind, strong metaphors of negative thoughts and feelings right there just as present as the night my subconscious showed me them through the aid of hallucinogenic drugs.

I felt sick and scared at the darkness in these thoughts and as stuart my husband walked past the bed I told him about the dream I had had, he said " wow thats quite a strong imagine, receiving comfort with food".

He was right, I've done that all my life, food which was demonized by my mother became the replacement for the missing love, I've always known this though? so why is my mind making this important to me now?


either way I need to start to really listen and figure out a plan to re-gain who I am rather then what was done to me.
