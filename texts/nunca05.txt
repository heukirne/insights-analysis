i hate remembering him.
everytime i do i remember the greatest heartbreak of my life.
i hardly even knew him. i only actually was around him a couple of times.
it's not like i loved him.
but he was the most special boy in my life.
and the songs...
i remember the singing.
i remember the biggest crowd of butterflies i'd ever felt in my stomach.
and i miss it.

i miss feeling like i couldn't breath in a good way.
and i miss physically shaking with the feeling of happiness.
i miss closing my eyes and imagining what it would be like to kiss him.
I wish I could have kissed him.

maybe it would all be less painful.
