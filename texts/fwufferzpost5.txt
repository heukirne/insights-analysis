A space:
It can be limiting,
restricting,
as it closes in around you.
You can feel lost and trapped, amid
endless circles.
You feel for a catch, an escape, but all you see are perfect
Curves
Slowly embracing you,
Slowly suffocating you.
Each step takes you closer to the
end -
which is the center.
The middle of the swirling vortex, the vacuum
of the black hole.

You're there - you stumble forward
An opening, a clearing.
You look up, and the vortex gives way to
Blue sky.
Sunshine.

Freedom, it's there
All you have to do is make it through
and look up.
