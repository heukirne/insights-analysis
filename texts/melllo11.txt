Sometimes i think about everything i've gone through and wonder, What if? 
What if i Never met Him? 
What if i never Lasted almost a year in a relationship with you? 
Would it make me a better person? Or would i still have just turned out exactly the same? 
It's stuff like this that keeps me up at night.
I Finally graduated. I made it out alive, only to be thrown into a world that doesn't make any sense to me.
People who will step on others just to make a personal gain. In a world where the meaning of love 
has seemed to diminish into nothing. 
This post is basicly composed of random thoughts that make no sense. 
But they needed to come out. 
Being on my own is the most impowering thing i've ever had to endure.
i love the gains i make on my own, to so called personal victories i achieve just being on my own. 
its a wonderful feeling to know you've earned everything you have on your own. 
And that you can support yourself as a human being. and not need the help of someone else. 
I won't lie. 
Theres night where it gets really lonely. 
But its something i am learning to deal with. 
I am happy with myself as a person. 
And i am really glad thats how my life has turned out.
