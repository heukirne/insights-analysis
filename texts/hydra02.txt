Man what an awesome day. My career is really taking off and im really living the dream. I wish my social life were this good, but you have to sacrifice one to have the other I suppose. I'll work on that once I'm well-settled in Europe, and I'll definitely have the money to do some things I've wanted to do.

So many awesome things happened today business and accomplishment-wise that its hard to sum it all up, so I wont bother, but suffice to say I need new underwear to accommodate both the fact that I soiled myself, and that my dick is now 14 inches long.
