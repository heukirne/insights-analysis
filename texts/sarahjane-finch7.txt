So recently, literary the past week, I've started going back into chat rooms, i use to go into chat rooms a lot to alleviate my loneliness when i was a young teen, not the most practical place granted but it use to work.
They take as much as they give, an anonymous world of persona's pretending to me more then they really are but who will know?
I guess I went back to them for the same reasons, i just wanted people to talk to, exciting interactions, interesting connections.
It had been working really well, i met someone today thought that, in a digital sense whipped me off my feet, quick, witty, intelligent and terribly charming, I gave him a window into myself and he climbed in with both feet, unafraid of the circumstance, knowing I'd let him, knowing I'd wanted him too.
I want to let down all my barriers but unfortunately I've committed to being unsatisfied, so i feel i need to protect myself, he said I can trust him because he draws!, can you believe it!

Only time will tell, now I've had a little bit though, I want lots more.

He's reading this, or can if he wants to, so no longer am I communicating with myself, someones listening.
