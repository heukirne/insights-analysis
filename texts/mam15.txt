I'm wondering why I"m feeling so dreary? I think its because things have been piling up around the house, outside, and even in my office. I've been lazy and now I have to catch up with the piles. As much as I want to blame it all on someone I've come to understand that Randy is simply not going to see the piles or the need to do more than live around them, accomodate them. Gwen is 11 and helpful but has no initiative to clean, organize, throw out stuff. Sigh, I don't want to, either...oh well. Its my duty, job, responsibility, etc. Now that the hot weather is over, its not getting above 95 now, I can get on with the thankless work of cleaning up my world.

Gwen starts school on Tuesday. She's excited because she gets her favorite teacher for her homeroom and I'm excited because it looks like the principle has finally clustered the Gifted kids together--I've been asking for this for years. What school means for me is a tight schedule. Randy, too, has a tight schedule since he picks her up after school 3 nights a week although if my client load doesn't build up quickly he'll have more flexibility.

Okay. I'm going to try to defeat the drearies by creating order into the public areas of my house and in my yard. And I'll create a more orderly schedule.

I need to have more social time, too. Time with friends. Facebook does not replace the need to share space and laughter with living, breathing human beings.
