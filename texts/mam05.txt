Well, Gwen didn't make the two weeks. It turns out that the 10 days here and the week there with her friend was just too much. I'm hoping that the friendship isn't damaged irrepairably and that time and distance will allow the hurt feelings to dissipate.

Gwen was really, really happy to get home today. She had her first plane trip alone...and she walked off the plane with a fresh cookie in her hand. Not a bad intro to flying alone if you ask me.

So what did the week without Gwen bring? Well, I adjusted remarkably swiftly. Not that she allowed much time without her in my awareness since she started with the texts and phone calls, especially at night, on day 3. On day 8 she flew in. I was sad that I didn't get the full 2 weeks. I was missing her but it was not unbearable.

Randy and I discussed how I do friends vs how he does friends: He doesn't have many friendships that have lasted the years while I have several. Even my best friend in high school, Katie, is still among my friends; and I haven't seen her in years. Randy bases his friendships on WHO--who is this person? I base my friendships on HOW--how does this person do his/her life, how does this person interact with his/her environment. Things like that. Its odd: I don't really like people in general but I really do like people in the specific.

I'm going to begin to teach Gwen how to be more emotionally sensitive herself and to be more emotionally savvy about others. Body language, tone of voice cues, things like that. She has that little autistic twist that very bright people can have that can that makes human interaction a mystery. It can be trained out of them.

Ashely made cookies. Yippee!!
