I drove to LA for Gwen's biofeedback appointment. I have to go back on Thursday. She was too tired and cranky to get a good brain scan reading. Grumpy child. Now she's on the phone getting her math homework from a friend. Because the school forgot that there were 4 7th graders taking 8th grade math they don't have books so they have to get it from each other. I'm waiting to be stinky until Back to School Night on Wednesday when I find out if this is to be a permenent status.
