The Vietnamese restaurant that we love to go to. :) That's really it. lol

So on Wednesday I decided to apply to work at Bryan's call centre. I would be able to make enough so that I wouldn't have to keep taking my Dad's money. And in some of those departments I would make MORE than the money dad gave me each month plus my pay at arby's. It's not really what I want to do obviously as I hate call centres, but I feel I need to. I wasn't expecting a call back the next day however. I have to leave for my interview in about fifteen minutes. I'm really nervous because I am not sure what departments they are hiring for. Bryan heard rumours that the company itself might be hiring for hr/clerical stuff which would be nice, but you know...rumours in call centres are like trees in forests. You can't rely on everything you hear. For example, the last one I worked at...4 people got fired one day because they were jerks. lol. I don't know why but they basically weren't doing their job. But what I heard before I heard the truth? they were going on a firing spree and had fired 47 people that day. O_O lol

I was going to post about this yesterday but I had been busy watching Supernatural with  waltzforanight . We are done Season 1 now yaye!!! I am excited to start Season Two since apparently it is freaking crazy. *cannot wait* I don't know why I didn't start watchingt he show when it first came on. It totally looked cool but I just never did. And now I am so very behind.
