Back at my parents house again. It's interesting living here, with boundaries and rules once again. There still isn't that many, but I can't be completely open with everything that I do now. It'll be nice not having to pay for my own food, and having internet again. Can't throw any more fatass parties anymore either =/. I feel I've grown appreciative alot more for what my parents have done for me, and I'm actually willing to pull my own weight now.
