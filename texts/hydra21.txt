Nokia corporation is proud to present its May edition of Nokia Connecting Worlds. This month we will be inviting several large companies that have had success with implementing virtual worlds in their business practices, and exploring how those practices can benefit other corporations with thoughts of moving in themselves. Since the two are naturally linked, we will also be exploring behind-firewall solutions and their viability for corporate virtual world usage.
