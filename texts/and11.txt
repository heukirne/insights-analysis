I hate not knowing how I am feeling. I don't even understand what is going on in my head.
I feel horrible for leading Brendan on the way I did. Even if it only was for a week. I shouldn't have done that and I shouldn't have let him down. I wish it was what I wanted but it wasn't and he wasn't but I don't know what is.

But for just a little while on friday night I felt the butterflies. About a boy I didn't know but who knew me. A boy I couldn't stop looking at.

But I'm not stupid. I know who he reminds me of and I can't tell if that is the only reason I started looking at him in the first place.

I am so fucking ridiculous. I only hurt people.
