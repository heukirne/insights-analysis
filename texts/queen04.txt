I just wanted to write a note to say, I got through my presentation successfully today! Per usual, I worry too much, but I work diligently and everything turns out great! The presentation started out with my cooperating professor saying really nice things about the hardcore professor, and she apologized in advance for any faultiness in her ABA terminology. Then she defined group contingencies and how they are used. After each definition I presented examples and techniques I have used effectively in my classroom. At the end I talked about some data collection sheets I designed, and I explained the premise of my research thesis. My peers had nothing but great things to say about the presentation, and a lot of them loved the framework of my thesis. The hardcore professor was there, like I had anticipated. However, after my presentation he said, "Great job!" and (like Simon) he is not the kind of person who would just throw those words out there. The professor I worked with just sent me an e-mail: NICE JOB!!! You are terrific, Amanda. Thanks for your willingness. It was terrific. So all in all a success, it doesn't get much better than that! Now I need to get back to studying for my 100 point exam which could be on any of the 600 terms on our study sheet... One challenge down, one to go... almost done!
