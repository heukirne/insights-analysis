I woke up about 4:30; just woke up. I hate it when that happens. I feel crabby and my eyes burn; not enough sleep but I can't sleep anymore. I get up and try reading, admonish Koko for beating the little cats, make some coffee. My theory is that some hot coffee will soothe me and relax whatever it is that isn't letting me go back to sleep. Maybe a brain dump will help. Nothing to dump. Ate too much last night at Uozumi's; don't like Gwen's little girlfriend; nope, nothing worth not sleeping over. Probably stupid hormones. I'll go back to bed in a minute.
