For some reason tonight this Mat Kearney song is really making sense to me: "Can't Break Her Fall". It is resonating with my simultaneous desire to be a true friend and the realization that I cannot control other people's choices. In the past, I thought that to really help someone I had to make sure they changed to what I thought was a good behavior. I'm really not sure that's the case, nowawdays. Maybe we're just supposed to love and "sit with" people in their grief and pain and bad decisions. Maybe we're supposed to be the voice of hope and love and patience. Maybe we're supposed to have and show grace, so that when we are the one sitting on the other side of the table, we have an understanding ear. Maybe we just remind each other who we are. And more importantly, who God is. Who He says we are. I'm learning that love might be the opposite of control. Yikes.....
