im totally going to ruin this. i just know it is. but it's sooooo perfect!
someone new...who none of my friends knew or dated... he's beautiful as all hell and i have fun with him... at the very least he thinks i'm pretty! it's a start right?

i just HAVE to surpress my hopes because i know i'm going to end up disappointed. im such an idiot for letting it get THIS far. but i'm definitely going to screw it up. blah.

asdnkjfbg i am good at doing that you know
