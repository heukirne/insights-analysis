Gwen had her biofeedback today and I realized that she is extraordinarily hyper, grumpy, manipulative, and just miserable to be around afterward. And she is soooo needy of my attention. With Randy gone to Conniticut I have the full and undivided focus of her energy. I finally got her to ground and it helped. Now I'm sitting with her as she eats some hot cereal and I hope go to bed.

The fire is coming over the hills and down into Littlerock. Its scary how fast this fire has spread--135 square miles in 5 days and no hint of containment. They are trying to protect structures and let it burn itself out. Not happening. We are safe, I think. We live quite a ways from the hills--3-4 miles and there isn't much for the fire to feed off of here on the desert floor. In the hills and on the mountains there is lots of chapparel and pines.

I'm worried suddenly about the monks up at the Abby. And there are lots of people who live up in the hills.

Its late enough I'm going to bed. Randy won't be home until Wednesday...he's at an important meeting in some New England town being wined and dined by "customers". Hope that he has fun. Probably not, his flight out this morning left at 6:30ish and the one home leaves about the same there--he has to get up at midnight PST to make the plane. Business travel isn't glamorous.
