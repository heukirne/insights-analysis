I feel really sad today.  Lexapro has been making me tired enough to nap everyday, but today when I was trying to nap, I started thinking about the upcoming spring semester, going back to school, and that project.  I started to panic a little.  I'm pretty sure if I weren't on the Lexpro, I would've had a crying spell, full-out, breakdown panic attack.  I could feel the emotions welling up, but they were blocked in a way.  I just kept thinking about how I can't do it.  I was supposed to graduate with Mark, but I couldn't.  Then I was supposed to graduate on my own the year after, but I couldn't.  And then I was supposed to go back to school last spring, but I couldn't do that either.  I just feel blocked and sad, unable to cope with stress, failure, and pain.  I'm terrified of going back to school because I'm afraid I'll fail again.  And that's the exact word: terrified.  Who do I talk to about it?  What do I do?
