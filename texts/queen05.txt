If you don't hear from me it's because I'm out of the country! I'm currently re-living the college dorm experience and currently making a class schedule of the classes I am taking at the Known World Dance Symposium. Even though I have internet here, I am planning on dancing until my feet tire for the next three days! Hope all is going well. Canada has been amazing, but I'll write more later.
