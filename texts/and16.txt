Where is the sun today? That's what I'd like to know.


I fell in love again last night. There was someone in my dream.



I feel old and worn. You seem a hundred years younger than me so I can't understand you. I like being alone. I hate being lonely.

I liked the couple that sat opposite each other. He read the paper and she went on her laptop. They each had a coffee and she shared her sandwich with him. There was comfort, contentedness and certainty. He kissed her goodbye and said he would see her at five. I liked it.



I still miss it. Do I miss him? I miss myself when I was with him.
