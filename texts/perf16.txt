I finished a batch of houses yesterday afternoon and took them for an outing to the park the runs along the river near my home. The late afternoon sun did some interesting things with shadows and I love the way it slants through the illuminates the plants on the forest floor.

(there are other pics, if you're interested - click on the photo and it'll take you to them on flickr)

All in all, it was a good day; I began the day at the gym, running on the treadmill and doing some strength-training. Then more stuff in the studio, household chores, and then this photoshoot. I *heart* doing the photoshoots - they combine many things I LOVE, like being in the out-of-doors, art and imagination. I think I mutter to myself when I'm setting up the shots, and I wonder if the dogwalkers think I'm nuts.

Then I had dinner plans with a new friend, at Garden Grille. Instead of driving, I walked; and not the short way, either. I walked up Angell to Hope St. and made it a three-miler :-) Denise and I had a super time. I know we'll be hanging out some more!

Today, if we can get our arses in gear, Eric and I are going on a hike. Or an outdoors walk. Whatever.
