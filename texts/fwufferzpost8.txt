So I never ended up posting about what I said I would write about in my last post. (a little voice inside my head is shouting: So typical!)

Also looking at trends - my last post was made during finals week.

....It's finals week again! This time I'm in my second year of medical school, so I am understandably substantially more stressed out this time around. Each time finals week hits, I hate on myself for a good while and tell myself that I'm never letting myself get to this point again. The cramming, the nights that never seem to end but become much too short, the apprehension during the test, the sense of worthlessness and failure afterwards. Academic hardships are real. I never try my best for these things, which is what kills me the most.

Also, one of my cats is sick. I've locked him in the bedroom with me so he doesn't get my other cat sick, but now he's just trying to step all over my computer and disrupt my studying/not-studying. Silly cat.

This weekend I'm visiting Anna with Elaine in Salt Lake City. I don't think I deserve this trip.
