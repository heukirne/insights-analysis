It was definitely one of the stranger dreams, but it was one of those ones that actually got rid of a bit of a cloud.

It starred Ian, which is odd because those dreams for the most part stopped a long time ago. 

Basically it was him saying "i am sorry" and me going "i forgive you" and me winding up back to jon and being ok. no "i have feelings for you still" or "i still want you" like they used to be, or anger from him like they often were, just him saying "i am sorry"

Even if he would never say something like that in real life (and tbqh i am glad that i never expect to see him again), it still for some reason put a load off of my mind. it wasn't so much the idea of him saying sorry as it was me forgiving. 

we were both young. shit happens.

what matters now is that while i'm still young, i've grown up some, and i am happy with where i am.
