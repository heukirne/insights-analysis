It seems like too much time had passed by. I was here recovering from injuries and disease. I was sure I was getting better, but in some ways it seems like it didn't matter anymore. Fall had stuck the land, like the turning of a page. The orange light making the day feel like it never happens. Inside, I was having dreams about winter. It seemed like, somehow, I could see the snow falling.

Since moving here, I seem to be experiencing the seasons for the first time; maybe I spent too much time inside. Everything felt new, and I wasn't sure what to expect for the future.
