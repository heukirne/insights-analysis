I had a pretty awesome day. I hung out with a friend that " haven't spent time with since I was 14 and didn't think I would ever see again. It was a good time and I now know about this really great vegetarian restaurant that had tasty simulated meat products. Lemon chicken that tastes like chicken but isn't....

Also, we hung out and watched T.V just like we used to when we were younger. SO much fun.

I'm tired and hung over from last night and a part of me wants to go sit in the sun somewhere (the part that doesn't remember that I turn purple and blister ir red and itchy I guess) and a part of me wants to curl up and have a nap. I can't combine the two because around Whyte Ave I think it's only the homeless people that sleep outside. Also, someone may take my shoes. 

One thing is certain, all of me is hungry. I should have taken my delicious leftovers home. Anyone want to go out for a veggie burger?
