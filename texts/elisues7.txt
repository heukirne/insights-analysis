i have missed you. its only too easy to lose contact with you with the distraction of life. i take you for granted and only call out to you when i find myself in need. but you're always there for me. you honour your side of the bargain time and time again and even though i am often unfaithful, you still find ways to show me that you love me. you're a fixture in my life and you deserve all the gratitude i can offer up.

i do want to be close to you. i want to constantly feel your calming presence in my life because with all the variables life throws at me, you're constant, ever unchanging and eternally dependable. thank you for ensuring everything works out for your good, thank you for giving me joy every single day of my life, thank you for always ensuring i never have to go through any trial or tribulation that is too large for me to handle. thank you for being so merciless despite my glaring imperfections.

draw me closer to you.
