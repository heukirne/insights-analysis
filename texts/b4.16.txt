Feeling slightly better today. Not really sure why.

Talked to Mom and she has this brilliant plan to move to Calgary--except she's not calling her mother to tell her! She's just going to show up and move in with her; I'm sure it will be a wonderful surprise. This puts her beyond my scope of influence, and beyond my capability to help her.  She had me call my Grandmother and my Aunt so I could tell them. Didn't get ahold of either of them.

Not much else is going on. I'm watching a newlywed couple cart gifts out to their car.
