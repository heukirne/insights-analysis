So I came to the city library so that I could print off my resumes and etc because I want to apply for a job that is only accepting them by mail. Yeah...the printer isn't working so I have to sit here and wait for the guy to test it to see if he can fix it. Because that's what I want to do right now. I have other stuff to do to guys wtf. That I am still really tired from not getting home until really late last night. 

After this though I am also going to go and mail my mother's day card for my mom. Yeah I know...I'm REALLY late. lol

Hopefully this gets fixed before my time is up because I really would like to apply for this job today so I can get it done and such. *nods*

I seriously need to get ink or something for ours but I do not like spending that much for ink. Stupid Lexmark. It wouldn't be bad if they didn't always just dry out, but I can't do much about that.
