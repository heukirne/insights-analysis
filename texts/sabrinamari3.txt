Ths weekend we have celebrated a new tradition:  PassEastara

Friday Bill came over, and with the help of Angela, Michael and I orchestrated a fantastic seder.

We had 13 rowdy guests and it was tremendous fun and great deliciousness!

Saturday was a gaming day and some of us played Betrayal on House on the Hill and colored eggs.

David and Tracy joined us that evening to enjoy photos and stories of Yucatan and discuss working out.

This morning Michael and I stayed in bed, laughed and played and got up in happiness. Michael hid eggs for Trent to find in very sneaky and clever places, and we had a silly time.

Later today, we will go to a river, stand on a bridge and throw red eggs into the rushing water to welcome the coming spring with joy.

I love PassEastara!
