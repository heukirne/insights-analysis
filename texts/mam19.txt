Gwen's off to hunt geodes with a friend; I've made a peach pie because Gwen has been on a pi (spelled correctly) kick of late; Becky and Ellery are playing Animal Crossing on the Wi; Randy is reading and Ahley is being a ghost. So much for the Sunday Report.

This morning over coffee Becky and I decided that we all would run away to some small liberal arts college town and open up a tea shop and Pokemon museum a la the Mount Horeb Mountain Mustard Museum. Everything would be themed: Brock scones, Misty Clam Chowder, Prof. Oak salad, Ash and Max sandwichs and Nurse Joy juices. We'd host after school pokemon card tournements and a homework club that the college students would volunteer to work in exchange for a free sandwich and drink. After 6pm when the kiddies went home we'd host Bad Poetry night, Fun Pun night, Naughty Limerick night and an unplugged jazz night. We decided that if we each brought in $25K and the tea shop and museum netted an additional $25K we'd live like oddball king and queens. Gwen likes the idea. The where is still up for deciding.

The problem is finding a place that will give Becky the natural history museum where she wants to be a curator; a good enough airport so Randy can consult with NASA or other good companies; and a population that will allow me to be a therapist or psychic advisor. Its got to be small enough, at the same time, that we can walk to work, enjoy our neighbors, and the biggest crime is someone getting too drunk at the local pub and busting someone's lip. Oh yeah, and the weather needs to be on the wet side without being too extreme. Ah well...

Oh yeah, I told Randy I'd make some more coffee. Better go do it then I'll play Animal Crossing on my DS some more. I started the game over and paid off my first mortgage today!! WooHoo!!
