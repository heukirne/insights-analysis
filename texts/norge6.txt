it's another day. and these are the lives we have. and indeed, we ought to be productive and intentional. we must labour, for that is what we have been called to do.
      
the challenge for me is transitioning out of a 3 year crisis into the "real world".

      i want to move forward. and obviously, there are a great many suggestions to be given on how to do so. and i'd venture to say that i know what most of them are. but pushing myself enough to "climb" out of the deep hole that i've unconsciously dug... it's daunting to think about, to say the least. but i can do it. because nothing is impossible with God.

      for at least the first couple of years, i unwaveringly wanted it to be my grave. but that's not what i want it to be anymore. i wanna get out of it completely and fill it back up to the brim with dirt.
