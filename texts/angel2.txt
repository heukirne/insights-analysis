I'm pretty sleepy again.  I slept a full night, and now, at noon, I'm ready for a nap.  I've been on antidepressants for a few months, so it could be that...  I'm not sure if they're really working.  I mean, I wasn't really depressed--mostly anxious.  I still have a lot of my anxieties, but now I find it physically difficult to think about certain things.  (I get headaches and confusion, and I tend to zone out a lot.)  I really don't know what else to do to help myself.  I'm just drifting through life...  I wish I were different.  But, a lot of my self-hatred is gone.  I'm a really sad excuse for a human being, but that's just how it is.  Anywho, I've thrown myself into caring for my cats.  Lubb dem.
