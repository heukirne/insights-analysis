I used to just want someone near me. Anyone. Someone to put their arms around me and keep me warm and fend off the loneliness that comes with being human. I just wanted some affection, like I had had for two years.

But now I only want his arms around me. I only want to fall asleep next to him. I want to wake up before he does and trace his tattoos with my fingers over and over and touch his hair and feel safe. I want to lie on my bed just looking at him and be so scared of how much we were feeling.

Fuck this is ridiculous.
I'm sure he has forgotten that I exist.
Why am I still here?
