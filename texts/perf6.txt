Last night I went out to dim sum with friends and then on to the This American Life movie/event. It was so cool - we got to see what it looks like to put on a live show and it WAS live, broadcast to four hundred theatres across the country. Ira Glass is adorable (sorry, Ira, don't mean to objectify ya) and he had great guests, some of whom I knew and loved (Joss Whedon), some of whom I knew of but never fully appreciated before (Mike Burbiglia) and some of whom were delightful surprises (Starlee Kine). There was also an animated short by Chris Ware, whom I LOVE with music by Andrew Bird (whom I NOW love.) It was a blast.

Now I am editing photos, uploading new stuff to my Etsy shop and watching season one of "Californication." I forgot how hot David Duchovny is. I'm going to have to break out that old Bree Sharp song!

Weather is lovely, windows are FINALLY OPEN, life is gooooooooood.
