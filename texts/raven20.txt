I had a total anxiety attack today and it was just...weird. It was really upsetting because it's been awhile since I've had one. I mean, I've felt really upset like I used to but not often. It's been atleast a full year since I had an actual anxiety attack and you know what it was over? Going to the mall.

i didn't want to go to the mall because I didn't want to be reminded how much money I don't have, I didn't want to walk around with all the skinny more attractive girls for me to see and make me feel fat and ugly (really feeling this low self esteem lately), and i didn't want to try clothes on that make me feel fat AND remind me how much money I don't have. That and the htought of being around a lot of people left me all blegh.

The problem? Not going to the mall meant either not spending time with Dayna and Lacie or making them stay home and feeling like a bitch. The thought of either being left out/feeling like I was a bitch just added MORE to the anxiety. I ended up just sitting on the couch with Bryan and crying for like ten minutes straight before I finally calmed down. It was...not fun to say the least, but in the end I decided to stay home. I had some lunch, painted some of my minotaur miniature, and watched a movie with Bryan. I wanted to spend time with them, but I am so glad I didn't go to the mall. I know I was much happier for it.

Hopefully I don't have another one of those anytime soon. Blegh. So glad to be over it.
