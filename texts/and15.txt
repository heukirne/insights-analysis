I feel like sewing.
I feel like wearing hats.

I feel like looking pretty and being creative and making delicate things.

I see pins and lace and glitter.
I see sunshine and cups of tea gone cold because I am too wrapped up in my project.

I want simplicity. I want the freedom that comes with capital. Some pennies in my pockets to pay for all the fabric and mis-matched buttons.

I want to sew me some clothes.
