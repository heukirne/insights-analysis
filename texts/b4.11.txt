There have been a few of those dark days lately. But, right in the middle of everything came a gutterflower of an event. I have been trying to volunteer for the Sorrentino's Compassion House for a couple of months but it had never worked out. Today I had a meeting with one of the organizers of the house. I had told them that I have a background in writing and they decided that as part of my volunteer work they would like me to write down the stories of women that come through there. I was so happy, and so touched that I would have the oppurtunity to speak to these cancer survivors and women going throught treatment. To be able to collect stories like that is everything a writer hopes for. 

This also comes with ideas. If I could collect enougn stories, maybe I could put together a book and direct the profits towards the Compassion House. 

It's very exciting. I now have two volunteering experiences that have to do with writing. I also have more material to write about. 

I'm feeling better, and though not exactly bouyant I am feeling more confidant. There are still good things in the world, and hopefully volunteering will remind me of some of the good stuff. 

I'm still afraid though. I'm still apprehensive. I still have this swirrling, bubbling black cauldron of feelings. I am resentful that I have to bear a burden that shouldn't be mine. I'm not her mother, she's mine. I don't know what to do. A part of me wants to run away from all of it, and a part of me is feeling very confrontational. This subject brings me back to places that I don't want to be, and it stirs up memories that I have buried. Some things I don't know if I will ever be able to "deal" with; some things are better left buried.
