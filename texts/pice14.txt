There were words that went amiss
Words that could never explain;
Feelings, emotions, the madness within
when you walked away, left unsaid.

There were words of colour, words of hate.
There were words upon words that I just ate.
I held it in, left unsaid.
Left unsaid.

I forgave, I forgot, I never said I do not.
I never said
and that's the problem,
Left Unsaid.

I gave up, I quit trying
I said I would rather die.
So I held it all in, imploded from within,
left unsaid, left unsaid.

I left it all behind
And moved on inside.
Left my voice off to the side.
and left it unsaid.

I never said, I forgive you.
I never said, I'm sorry.
I never said, I tried.
Left it unsaid.

And now I will never say,
Goodbye.
I left it unsaid.
