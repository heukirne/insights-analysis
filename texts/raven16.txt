Thankfully no. I would be scared shitless if I had to do that. I  mean...what if they died? That would be traumatizing. Also, if I had to I still would. It would just be scary shit. And I would rather not have to use it. Plus...it's been WAY too long since I have been trained so I would probably mess up.

Having an awesome time roleplaying tonight. Bryan's adventures are way better than the usual modules though sometimes they are good. Anyway, we're on a ship and we got attacked by fishmen people dudes. lol. We had all but the big boss guy dead and he was almost dead. So he took Bechard's spiffy axe (he'd knockedi t out of his hand earlier) and jumped into the ocean with it. Him without his axe would have screwed the party over royally because he's our biggest damage dealer. So my character (a druid) just dives off the boat after him, turning into a shark and chasing this guy. I attacked but his AC is WAY too high so I miss. But to attack me he drops it so I swim and grab the axe and swim up the ship, turning into an octopus so I can climb up the side as welll as swim incase this guy pulls me in. He comes to attack me but then Bechard kills him before he can do more damage to me.

This may be lame to most but it was FUN! lol. I got to be a shark AND an octopus. Keep in mind that when I dove into the water I was a gryphon! lol
