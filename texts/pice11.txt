
Anyhow, here we are again another school year has flown past and I am one step closer to having 3 tiny letters behind my name that should have some meaning. The question that remains to be seen now is whether or not I'll actually put them to any use. I am becoming increasingly uncertain about that fact. Moreover, the longer I go the more i realize I still haven't got a clue what I am going to do with life. Just when I think I have it, the self-doubt, uncertainty and questions begin to creep in. This makes me rather depressed lately; I still sometimes feel as if no matter how hard I try, how much effort, despite top marks, that I am good enough to pursue anything further than just undergraduate level. I must admit, I love research and working with people. The thing is, I also love comfortability and safety. The further I go, the more extroverted I become the more introverted my affect relishes to the point where I am scared that I just will not be able to relate emotionally to anyone any longer. It's hard to explain, seems counter intuitive that someone extroverted would be so emotionally introverted. Yet, the more I continue to feel like very few if anyone can really understand the things that plague my mind. I love attention and friendship, but I find comfort in solitude and revert inwards when things get tough or stressful. I am becoming increasingly burdened with my lack of compassion for people who are lazy, who abuse their gifts, who don't put forth any effort, who act out of insane stupidity when they are not that stupid, that I just want to walk up and punch them in the face. I feel so hollow inside, uneven.
