I look at you sometimes, 
and see what i've gotten out of you 
i feel thankful. 
It makes me feel safe, and it makes me 
feel like this is it, this is all i really needed
in my life.
It makes me look at you, in such a way
that ive never seen anyone before.
Its a whole new entire light
that really shows me what its like, 
to have someone care for me. 
in a whole different manner.
someone who subconciously & conciously loves me
Something ive never seen or felt before for that matter.
I have the most respect for you. 
I have respect for the fact that you respect me.
i have respect for the fact that even in an extreme situation 
you can still pull your head out of your ass and think for me too.

you have no idea how much what you've said and done 
has impacted me.
Maybe in such a way that'll make me never look forlove again. 
Maybe its good. maybe it isn't. 
All i know is deep down, 
your going to be there.


And i would'nt have it.. 
any other way.


I love you. 
More than any silly words can describe.
Don't you ever forget that either.
