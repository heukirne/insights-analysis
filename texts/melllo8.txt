Getting that feeling again. 
The suffocating one. 
Where i feel like i can't catch my breath. 

And that my world is caving in around me.
I take all of your shit. 
Everything you say to me and more. 
I take it all in everyday. 

And conciously weigh it against the positives. 
All the things you say to me. 
like How much you love me, 
and how perfect i am. 

All the things you tell me. 
like how i am beautiful. 
but fucking some whore whose hot puts excitement into your life. 
I don't understand it. 

I feel like its something ill never get.
Why do i take all this shit from you? 
When i know deep down its something i told myself id never do. 

Why do i constantly let you walk all over me, 
telling me who i can and can't talk to. 
And who i can, and can't spend my time with?

Its something ill never understand.
Is it love? 
I know deep down that your the one id like to spend my life with. 
But under the conditions present i don't know if its something you'd want too. 

I feel like theres too much of you not ready for this. 
Not ready to be mature about a situation as delacate and perfect as this. 

maybe i am jumping the gun. 
But mother always said follow your gut instinct.
and i am not too sure where mines going anymore.
