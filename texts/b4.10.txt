I have a temporary costume at work because the old one started falling apart on me. This one is kind of damaging to the self-esteem because all of my co-workers either burst out laughin or come over to tell me how bad I look. It gets to you after awhile. I know I'm not looking really cute but I don't need to be constantly reminded.

My actual costume has not even been sewed yet, and we're almost into July....
