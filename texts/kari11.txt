Sometimes I wonder why the fuck I try to betray my happiness.

Is it still being scared to be happy? Is it still being so afraid of having reactions and actions towards me turned, like they have in the past? 

I'm not insecure towards him. I know he loves me, without a doubt loves me. I'm not afraid of him stopping that. I keep showing him my flaws just to see if his face will ever change. It doesn't. Am I really just trying to find one thing, ONE THING that will send him over?

He knows all my secrets now. The nasty ones, and even the stupid ones. And he still think I'm cool. 

So what am I feeling? I know without a doubt that I love him. Care, trust, want. It's just slight dissociation. I'm still trying to get everything digested. 

I AM happy. Why the fuck do I keep trying to quell it?
