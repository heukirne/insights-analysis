I am uber proud of myself! Yesterday I cleaned the bathroom countertop. Cleaned the toilet. Cleaned the sink. Washed a load of clothes (ok, linens) all by myself, as in without ANY help, for the first time. I actually washed my own pots and pans. I vacuumed my room. made two beds. and most importantly, I cooked. like ACTUALLY cooked. Like I had two cans of tomato sauce and frozen chicken breasts. I cooked spaghetti. obviously who makes it from scratch scratch? but I made it like my mom makes it. I cooked .Without a box. for the VERY FIRST TIME EVER. and guess what.... IT WAS GOOD!!!

I was praying my parents would go out of town so I could attempt to play house and see if I could do it.

If I moved out, I could totally do it.
I am soooo proud. Like you have nooo idea. I've never done anything like that before. (i know i am soooooo spoiled. ok my bad. i just never have the time to try stuff. but it was grossing me out so much after my pawpaw left that I just had to clean it and I skipped my nap and everything.) I am sooooo tired right now. but it's the best tired feeling I've ever had. I could totally die happy. And I can't wait to tell my parents!!! :D
