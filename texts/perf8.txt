I had a pretty bad coupla days there, but things are looking up. 

"Hiding under the bed," however metaphorical, gave me a lot of time to ponder this summer malaise I feel. Something someone else said made me realize that I have had, from time to time, this kind of yucky, empty feeling on the weekends, too. I think it's related to not being in school. I had a very isolated childhood in some ways, which was alleviated when I was in school M-F. There I had friends and lots of interaction. At home, I was left to my own devices a lot. As an only child in a relatively rural setting, friends were usually not right down the block. My mom worked a lot, Dad was down in his study or in his workshop. The house was sooooo quiet. I was alone much of the time. I did spend part of my summers at our cottage, where friends were more plentiful... but I don't think I ever shook that feeling that wherever the action was, it was somewhere else, somewhere I could only hear at a distance. There must be a reason that the sound that makes me most depressed is the sound of children playing somewhere out of sight. Sad, huh?

So I'm feeling better, anyway, and plugging away at housework, fitness and art. 

I've been walking almost every day with my neighbor and her dog - 3.2 miles (up and back Blackstone Boulevard). I think last week I walked five days and went to the gym one of the two remaining days. That has felt really good, both for my physical fitness and my self-esteem.

Yesterday I (you might want to sit down for this) actually CALLED someone to talk, when I was feeling sad. Instead of bottling it up, I reached out. THAT IS HUGE. It shouldn't be, but it is.
