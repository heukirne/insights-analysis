The muse, or the creative process finally came back this afternoon. It was a WOooOSh feeling. The words spill into my head kind of scattered and disjointed and very excited like being wired on too much coffee or cocaine.

Of course I was on the bus and had no pen or paper in hand. "Why do you have to do this?" I asked, "can't you come back at a better time? Don't you see that I have no paper or pen?"

Of course, no answer. 

But anyway, I'm not crazy. I am crazy excited to finally feel inspired after a couple of months of what felt like writerly impotence.
