i can live my life, knowing i don't need you in it. 
I've never been so sure of anything ever before. 
Your worthless, and pathetic. I finally have somebody who respects me, 
and appriciates what i have to offer.

I never thought i'd find someone as sweet as him, 
but i did, and i would'nt give him up for the world. 

He EASILY towers over you.
And always will.
