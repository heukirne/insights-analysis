Certainly wasn't anywhere near as good as the first one, but it was still decent. My only real complaints that are what made the movie not as good for me were the addition of Leo (unneeded), the way they made his parents far sillier than before (amusing at first but then it got annoying), the twins (i just...I wanted to shoot myself whenever they were on screen), and the length of the movie. I don't know if it was just really long or if they paced it crappily. 

The things I did like though mostly involved robot fighting! lol. And lennox. The fight where optimist dies was AWESOME! he was so hardcore and I was like OMG YAYE! lol. And Ravage was freaking awesome. The way he was all stealthy and fast and yet awesome with those guns. He was cool. And when Bumblebee killed him by just grabbing him by the tail and dragging his hands down his spine so that he ripped everything off was like wtf! I did like how Optimist took Jetfire's parts and powered up...but the fact that that fight took like thirty seconds kind of sucked. It's like...playhing a really long, hard video game and then beating the boss in like....five hits. Very anti-climatic. lol

Shia LeBeouf was awesome though. As always. And as always...I would like to just...run over Megan Fox. I can't STAND her. Seriously.
