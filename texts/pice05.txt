Some said love was not for you and I
But I knew it couldn't be true
Because when I looked into your eyes
Dear love, it showed me you.

I found myself dreaming
I found my self laughing
I found myself Bleeding
Even screaming

For a window to your soul
Digging and scrapping a hole
down inside my heart
making me a little more whole

What are you doing to me?
These simple facts tare at me
And still they can't tare me away from you
But that's not what hurts.
It's the fact that I might not ever
Be able to follow through

Like a ton of bricks distance hits me
awaking me from this dream
No matter how hard I tried to wash my hands
I could never get them clean

What are you doing to me?
These simple facts tare at me
And still they can't tare me away from you
But that's not what hurts.
It's the fact that I might not ever
Be able to follow through

I found myself dreaming
I found my self laughing
I found myself Bleeding
Even screaming
For you.
