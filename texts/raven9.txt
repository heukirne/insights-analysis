just got back from my interview at Bryan's work. I have a second interview in like 2 hours. O_O. This makes me nervous. Oh well though. Hopefully I get it and can go from there and get better positions...or just find a clerical job. It pays better than Arby's though which I need way more than they can give me. 

Blegh to call centres.
