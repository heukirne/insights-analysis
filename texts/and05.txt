Just a quick thought.

Am I only interested in guys who have messed up childhoods and who are emotional wrecks?
Because when I think about it, every guy I have had feelings for was really messed up in some way or another.
And I know that most people in the world have issues and horrible things in their past, but seriously I have gone for some fucked up dudes.

Surely it's coincidence.
That would be weird if I did.




PS I absolutely give up trying to work out what's going on with Lukey. I am just going to take it as it comes. I am too tired to worry.
