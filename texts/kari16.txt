Reading back into a livejournal that includes posts from when I was only 14 is more than just slightly embarrassing. It's downright awful. I am indeed ashamed.

However, one thing stands. Marty, my dearest friend, you have been my dearest friend as long as I've had this thing. We've both grown up a lot over the years. Basically, even though I am not around as much to be able to talk to you, I never want you to think I don't think about you.

So, will I ever retire this damn thing? I'm thinking possibly so lately. I don't need it.

I've had it through Jack and through Ian, and unfortunately, I had no way of keeping up with it through the fiasco of the 2300 house. Should I keep it? Should I delete the damn thing and all of it's memories? No idea.
