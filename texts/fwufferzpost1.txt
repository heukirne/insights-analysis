I feel like I'm being petty and selfish and manipulative lately. I can't put in the effort to be patient, understanding, forgiving, etc. I'm acting on whims and I'm acting on ideals. I'm being narrow-minded and not at all magnanimous.

I always talk about myself on this blog... how sickening, especially when I never engage in any substantial level of introspection
