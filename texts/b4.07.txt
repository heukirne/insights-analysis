I thought I was suffering from allergies, which was strange because I don’t have allergies. Sadly, I was just getting sick. That explains the dip in mood I have been feeling for the past few days. I don’t think I have ever been sick in the summertime before. I thought it sucked to be sick in the cold, but the scorching weather is making me reconsider my viewpoint. I’ve been coughing like a tuberculosis patient. 
 
I called in sick for two days. Good thing I got a job so I could lounge around more. Missed the pride parade but I did make it to my friend’s birthday party. Vinyl. Drinking, laughing, pictures. It was fun. 
 
My foot was injured when someone stabbed their high heeled shoe into it. Ouch. You don’t think about the pressure per square inch on those things. Good thing I was tipsy, I felt it, but I wasn’t concerned.   
 
I also had coffee with Idris. I just love talking to him. He has a more mature viewpoint of the world than I do and he has given me useful advice on many occasions. He’s one of those people that I would like to see more of. I have heaps of friends to drink with, to do next to nothing with, or to run around in circles with. I have very few friends that I can talk to. Very few friends that are intellectually fulfilling. 
 
Also, went swimming with Joy. When we were fifteen we used to go swimming every day. The day was filled with warm nostalgia. 
 
Made final plans for Shambhala.
 
Ate delicious steak and potatoes at the Keg. 
 
All in all gentle reader, I’m not suffering so don’t worry about me.

Oh, and the lobby is full of priests *gasp* but they are Anglicans *whew*. There was a strange procession of robed men from the catholic church on whyte when I was on my way home from Amanda's birthday (it was early morning. I was dressed black sequined dress, red high heels and Adrian's sweater). I didn't stick around to see what was going on.
