1) I either completed or at least started nine of the eighteen things on today's to-do list. Plus a couple extra, like dish-washing and tidying up in studio.
2) Running again! Not going fast and not getting far, but it felt good. And I did it on a treadmill for the first time.
3) I went to the gym today. Yesterday I went on that monster walk. The day before, gym AND walk. The day before that, walk... and so on. I think I've worked out every day for nearly three weeks. Wait, is that possible...? Yep, I think it's true!!
4) Tomorrow morning I should have new houses to list!!
5) Trail mix from Trader Joe's
6) Nitrous oxide at the dentist, so I don't jump out of my skin.
7) Talking to Laura on the phone, however briefly, makes me happy.
8) Eric is proving for the umpteenth time to be a great husband.
9) Maybe a walk with June this evening?
10) 30 Rock & The Office tonight!
