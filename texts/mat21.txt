People live their lives out asking what next. Their whole lives based on the future. It's the conceived world of what everyone wants to be. It's something you can change, but does anybody really stop to think about what they've actually done? People distance themselves from what is real because they don't know how to handle reality. Wouldn't it be nice to live in a world that bent to your every will? Sometimes reality can be overwhelming, but it's easier to face it head on than fake your way away from what you don't believe is right. It's hard to live in a world where you don't make the rules.
