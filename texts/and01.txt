Oh freaking hell.

So Roman goes and tells me he has a giant crush on me blah blah. Pretty sure he just wants to sleep with me. Which I already knew because they has been a vibe between us since day one but I thought we would both be smart enough to ignore it seeing as he has a girlfriend/mark is his best friend/he's a sleaze. But no, he has to go and say it and kiss me and make me want to sleep with him even more.

I didn't.

Because all I was thinking about was (surprise surprise) Lukey.
I've thinking about why I didn't do anything with Roman. And why I didn't want to.
It was bugging me.
Then I worked it out.
Everything Roman says I feel like I can't trust. Every single word from his mouth is planned and thought through and only said to manipulate me.
But everything Lukey said to me was honest. He didn't always say much.
But when he did I never once thought he was carefully planning what he was saying in order to manipulate me. It was just honest. And I could tell it was honest. I didn't feel like he was playing a masive joke on me or pretending to be interested.
He was just so honest and wonderful and real.

Fuck.
The boy I want to sleep with is in Canberra.
The boy I want all the time is in Sydney.

I'm becoming a lesbian nun.
