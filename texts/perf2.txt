This has been a very "bookish" weekend. First there was our trip to the library yesterday, which - shamefully - is terribly rare. Then we went up to Cambridge yesterday. 

After brunch with our friend Debbie, we headed over to Million Year Picnic, the comic book store on Haaah-vahhd Squay-ah. I am frequently overwhelmed in that place. But I managed to pull it together and spend my money on some (more) Theo Ellsworth. I bought two of his zines and looked in vain for the one copy of "Capacity" the store computer claimed it had. We went over to the Coop where I hung out in the biology section forever and a day. Bought another book on the creationism/evolutionism debate and snagged the steampunk issue of MAKE while I was at it. Eric bought some fiction. On the way back to the car we stopped by a table of books (church booksale? there was a box for money and a note about the honor system). Eric and I both bought another book. 

So my night stand overflows with an embarrassment of riches. How nice :-)
