It doesnt matter what the fuck i do. 
It doesnt matter how nice i am, 
or how well shit is between us.
or how much i care.
or the promises i made.
The money i spent 
The time ive devoted to making it work.
It doesnt matter to you at all. 
Because it two seconds you throw it all away. 
Just because its a bad day for you. 
So it makes it a bad day for all of us. 
I dont even know anymore man.
I fucking love you.
More than anything.
and i don't know what the fuck to do.
Ugh.
