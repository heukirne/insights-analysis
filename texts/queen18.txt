When pondering love, I believe every love is both evolving and instant, yet perhaps not simultaneously or with the same vicissitudes.

Love happens. No matter how often or when or against rules. Love may be there at first or maybe it is instead camouflaged. It can be ignored, discarded or embraced.

For me, I've been in love many different times and those times I always saw love there from the very start. At first I might have ignored my feelings because feeling so was "forbidden" by societal ethics. Or maybe I was scared to embrace it because I was scared of falling too fast, deeply or quickly... maybe loosing balance and to teetering off the cliff of heartache. I've personally never been in a situation where two people hate each other and eventually start to develop love instead, but I've seen it happen. Perhaps that is an instance where love has been camouflaged for so long but is finally seen. Love is the buried treasure of the heart - it's always there to open but is discovered in one's beautiful life at different moments... or with different, amazing people!
