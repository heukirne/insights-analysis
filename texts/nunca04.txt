i had a dream last night that my friend malorie had a baby and made me the godmother and it was like the most amazing feeling ever.
today i went to walmart with my parents and ran into my friend Emily. Emily had a baby about a year ago and he was with her. he was soooo beautiful and adorable and it just hurt me to see him.

i know it's sooo retarded. but i want a baby. sometimes i feel like that's the only one i could count on is a baby. and i just want to hold a baby and hold them and not worry about the parent getting upset that i was holding them too much or idk. i just feel so conscious around other people's children but there's always some rule. i just feel this overwhelming urge to have a little baby of my own to make smile. i could trust my baby way before i could trust anyone else. but then i would have to deal with them growing up... idk if i could do that. lol i just want the babyness. haha
