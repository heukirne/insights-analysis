Today I broke a weeklong run of Good Days. Not spectacularly, so that's something - but assuredly Not. Good.

It started when I awoke at three am, with a rush of adrenalin. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, worrying. I could not get my heart to slow. You know, the "yooshz." It sucked. I will not write about my worries now, as it will just ramp up my system again. Suffice it to say that I never DID get back to sleep.

I had a little meltdown in the kitchen, and Eric held me. He's very good for that. 

It rained like crazy, so my photoshoot was a bit of a bust. And I didn't go on my walk with Pam, either. 

I ate weirdly. It was healthy, but way too much stuff. It made me feel gross.

I did take a COUPLE photos and do some chores, so I wasn't a complete mess; but I wasn't very effective today, either.

That's my big, fat ineffective day.
