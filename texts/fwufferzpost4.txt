Days just go by as a blur now. In the back of my mind, I am aware that I am supposed to be in *school*, where I am supposed to be doing *work*, but I've just been tossing all of that away. How much longer can I pretend that I don't need to be focused and productive?

In med school, everything just seems to be so much more important. Everything matters, or will make an impact on Your Future As a Doctor. Getting too far behind is not an option.

So I need to remind myself.

As much as I hate to admit this, my willpower and resolve aren't strong enough to do this alone. Please, let's work hard together before we regret the daily choices that we make.
