1) We had our yearly boiler cleaning & servicing today and the technician deemed it "lookin' good."
2) Said technician also asked me if I was a Brown student; which, considering that I haven't had my grey colored in MONTHS, is terribly flattering.
3) I think I remember how I did the neato texture on this latest house.
4) MMMmmm... dinner was wild rice and chicken mushrooms that Dave G. so generously shared with us yesterday.
5) A five mile walk today; especially cool considering how close I was to blowing off any exercise at all.
6) Sam is home from college for the summer! The sounds of trombone practice fill the house again :-)
7) LOVE my new ipod and am using it ALL the time now.
8) We got invited to a dinner party on Thursday by a new-ish friend.
9) I invited my new friend, Denise, to lunch on Wednesday
10) I like the way my cat Buster blinks at me when he's warm and full and sleepy :-)
