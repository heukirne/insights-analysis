i'm not upset or anything cuz i just really dont care but i feel like if i dont say some stuff i will forget to tell it to your stupid ass later sooo lol
mostly just that i think it's soooo pathetic how i told you i was done and wasnt going to talk to you again and you still had to send another text instead of ignoring me. and how after i never said anything you posted a BULLETIN about it without deleting me because you wanted me to read it and respond. and then furthermore you continued to discuss it with that trashy boy and then you saw MY best friend and decided you were going to try to convince HER that it was all me. i mean, really. how freaking idiotic are you? why on EARTH would MY best friend believe you and be on your side? you just made yourself seem like an idiot. and she hardly knew anything about it because it wasn't important enough to me to discuss with her. THEN you think that being a BAD friend to someone you're supposed to be friends with is going to make you feel better. going around spreading rumors about is not going to hurt me. i haven't stopped laughing since you started all this. but i feel bad for that girl because you're sitting here USING her to try to upset me and really you're just upsetting her by making her think there's something between me and someone she cares about. how bitchy are you????

and all of this i haven't responded to. because it's stupid. and i know it's driving you NUTS that you havent gotten a response. why else are you STILL talking about it when nobody else is? i'm only writing it on here because i know you wont even read it, lol.

youuuuu are tres tres tres pathetico, child. justtt sayin'
