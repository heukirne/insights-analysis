Started taking Pristiq. Internet reports call it "just a patent extender" in terms of it's (obvious) similarity to Effexor. However, Pristiq doesn't do the weight gain thing. Infact, even withing having taken it for very long, it's helped a bit with my bit of compulsive eating. I have this thing where I will eat if I don't feel full because I get a little scared that I'm not full.

I'm not near as anxious as I was before, either. I thought maybe I was a little bit decreased libido, but turns out I actually feel better than before. Slight anorgasmia, but I'm guessing that'll disappear soon like the nausea did.

I finally got BC (not taking it till next month), but I'm hoping it will work well. Yaz. My sister takes it, so I'll have to ask her what she thinks of it.
