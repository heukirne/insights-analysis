It was a Sunday in June, two days after our fifth wedding anniversary. Our church service had been moved from our "regularly scheduled location" on the School of Mines campus to a beautiful cabin in the hills. We gathered outside, sharing coffee and snacks under a mishmash of camping canopies. The worship leader handed out lyrics sheets and we sang amidst horses, trees, and the sound of kids excited by the outdoors. The sermon was a "digging in the dirt" (or a question posed by one of the church family) about the relevance/significance of the Old Testament to Christians today. We listened, chatted, discussed ....."what Old Testament tradition/ritual do you wish we still practiced"....and as the band came up for the last song, Ryan promised a special suprise at the end of the service. As we finished singing, Ryan asked for Erin and the Standishes to come up to the front. "Five years ago this past Friday, a boy named Joe said some vows to a girl named Katie. They've asked to share those vows with their church family here and to have Erin and I pray over them"
