So far I am loving this laptop. It plays L4D for sure and we are going to test some more later to make sure it works. I just have to get used to a few of the differences like the set up of the keyboard and the way Vista is set up. For the most part I like it (so far), but there are still a few things I find weird that I am not sure I like.

And now I will take time to explain the last few days since LJ ate my post when I tried before. ;)

First of all, vacations are awesome. lol. I have never booked off vacation time from work. Thursday we went to Colisanti's to spend the day with Lacie, Jay, and Connor. This is just a petting zoo and garden centre with some kiddy rides but it is still a lot of fun. The petting zoo was the best part! There were goats and deer and stuff and they would all jump in the way and etc of the food so it was a lot of fun. I got to pet a deer which was amazing. Last time we went here they all just ran away from everyone because there were too many people. I also pulled off some pink and blue eyeshadow which dayna said reminded her of cotton candy. Very proud as I can never do anything that crazy. I am always too afraid. 

Friday my Dad, brother and Judy came up for my graduation. I'm really glad I ended up going. Though the ceremony was a little boring it didn't drag on or anything. And it was so awesome to see some of the friends I haven't had a chance to see since school ended. Mostly it was good to spend the day with my family that I haven't seen since Easter. 

There was way more and interesting stuff I had posted about but I don't really remember what. Stupid LJ eating my post. lol I would redo the writer's block but all you need to know is being a teenager sucked and I am uber happy now so I would never be a teenager in ANY era! lol
