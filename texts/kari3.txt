Sort of impromtu went to a concert last night.

My friend had asked me about going all week, and then called me up yesterday mid-afternoon saying "hey I still have two tickets and no one to go with!" So, I went. I had wanted to go anyhow, but it's hard to push myself to leave lately.

Anyways, Hall and Oates concert. Really good! I admittedly didn't really know any Hall and Oates music, but it was a good time. Private Eyes kicks ass live.

Concert ended pretty early (around 9:30?) so we got some food at one of the bars nearby, and went for a movie. Adventureland is actually a lot better than I thought it would be, and had a damn good soundtrack. Worth watching.
