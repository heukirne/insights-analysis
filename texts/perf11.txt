I've been really consistent (again) about exercise lately. I've been walking a lot and going to the gym a lot. I think I've exercised ten days in a row - which might not be much for some of you, but seems almost unthinkable to me. This afternoon I went to the gym and pedaled away on the recumbent bike for a half an hour and did some strength-training for another fifteen minutes. But (and?) feeling unmotivated to create and a little depressed, I went on a three mile walk in the early evening. All this movement feels good. 

I feel positive about my art when I'm away from the studio, but a little panicky when I get in there. I've identified that the panicky feeling starts when I contemplate anything experimental. Anything with a significant unknown (how will I solve this problem, how will that look in the end?) makes me nervous. Am I just a art-wuss?

It was better to just go off on the walk and admit that I wasn't going to make anything today, rather than to spin around in circles in my studio. That's progress, I suppose.
