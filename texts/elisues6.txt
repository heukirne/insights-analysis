i want, more than anything, to be right back where i started. i long for the time i used to be fearless but vulnerable at the same time. i used to wear my heart on my sleeve, let my thoughts run wild and be completely uninhibited. however, time has wizened me up to the horrors of this world. my heart has since calloused itself with defence mechanisms and i now feel like i'm in a prison of my own doing.

i yearn for the gut wrenching, heart flipping emotions i once roller coastered myself through. maybe my time in the sun is over. maybe i've used up all the calling credit i'm allowed and no one can get through to me anymore.

the worst part is that i don't know how to deal with this. i don't know whether the onus is on me to change things (and if so i am genuinely clueless as to how i should go about doing this) or on someone else to make me feel like i'm living again.
