Crazy dream about playing the role of an Egyptian goddess and being totally, utterly bored. I looked great, and the pictures were fabulous. The reality was extremely tedious.

I ended up jumping off the bus with Michael, leaving my colleagues to carry on with whatever they were doing. Instead, Michael and I wandered through a street fair and talked to some weird and interesting people while exploring unusual merchant booths.

Much, much better.

Note to self: avoid high-profile, constraining roles. Go with freedom and fun instead!
