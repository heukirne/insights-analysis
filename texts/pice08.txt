Black Smoke, Rise UP
In the dead of winter, furnace roar.
A crackling of a fire softly burns
The Fresh Smell of New, arising out of old.
Now tell me Blackbird, as you rise UP
Tell me what you have done tonight.
What have you done?
Destruction and Creation
The ashes-reincarnation.

Just this once, For Once.
I'm not drunk and I'm not sad.
There is nothing inside that I want back.
But I just gotta ask
Do you wonder?
How I am tonight?
Don't go looking for solace in my eyes.
Because not every tear means you're going to cry.

So let the smoke rise up, rise UP.
From the depths below
There was nothing but dust
and the layers are finally healing, let go.

Let the smoke rise UP
Coming from the big black deep
Can you hear the Blackbird singing her song.
Singing along to the waking of winter's sleeping tongue.

The old desires are bored. New ones are born.
Times for change as the Skies are opening
The black pool is washing away
Where old thoughts break off exploding into space.
Time passing by at it's rapid pace.
And then dancing off into the distance.
Hell-Bent and dignified, Always head-strong.
She was never wrong.

From the ashes of the heat
comes an army of one
Marching back up the steps
Mounting the horse one more time
Wth pale faces and hollow eyes.
Not every smile means
That I'm not empty inside.
Laughing, Laughing, Laughing

Black Smoke Rise UP
Rise UP, Rise UP
From the depths below
There was nothing but dust.
And now I'm watching you go.

Black Smoke Rise UP
coming from the deep
Can you hear the Blackbird singing along.
This after all was her song.

Ray of Shine burn on
Bottom of my heart has one.
New desires burn
Sining ballads in the sun.
To the Blackbird Rising up
The Battle is won.
