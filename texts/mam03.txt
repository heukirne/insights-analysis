We took the girls to the San Diego Wild Animal Park and saw lots of fun animals, mostly the herd animals--gazelles, antelopes, rhinos, giraffes, and deer--and a few predators like the cheetah and the lion. There were lots of birds too. What I like about this particular zoo is that there aren't any cages although the zebra have their own pasture and the big cats are in enclosures of several acres each...and there were toys, like the Land Rover that the big male lion was using to sleep on. Apparently zebra don't share and tired to drive the giraffes off their grazing area; they got aggressive and bit a tail off one of the giraffes.


When we got home I found that I have ants attacking my kitchen! I haven't had ants in the house in a couple of years--we get the outside perimeter of the house sprayed every other month to keep the nastys at bay but the heat, apparently, has driven them indoors.

Gwen's down to 30 mg of her Medidate; down from a high of 60 mg. She's a little bouncy today but not bad; as much from the 3-4 hours sleep last night, I think, and the car ride down and back again--a mere 6 hours in the car crammed up between two other people in the back seat.
