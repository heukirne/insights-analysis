The deeper I get into my rather...unique...career, the more I feel like I am becoming like the machines I work with. The funny thing is, my online identity means more to me these days than my real life self. Google my real name and there's 2 entries. Google Hydra Shaftoe and there's hundreds all the way from second life, to corporate boards, to Eve Online. I suppose my online self is more of my identity than my real world self, odd as that sounds.

I also feel not crippled, but absolutely mauled, whenever I am forced to be away from data networks. Its like a part of my body is missing when I cant at least get a basic link to the outside, and I spend inordinate amounts of time trying desperately to find a wireless signal, banging on the celphone, and otherwise trying to connect to my virtual identity.

I suppose some might view this as an addiction, and it very well may be, but from my perspective, its more like I have an expanded identity, and its downright painful to be separated from the "real me". Im not sure how to put this into words, honestly. Is it addiction if I feel like I have to have something to make my identity complete? My physical body is just the meat behind the keyboard that is the machinery that supports the identity, which I view as "me".
