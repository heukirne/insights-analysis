So i hate how i always end up getting attached so easily to people.
Its such a bad habit. I like to consider myself an independent person, 
but when i feel the need to rely on somone else so much i start doubting myself.
and i start to become something that isnt me. It isnt fair. and it isn't what i want. 
I hate feeling as though i can't be myself. 
I hate feeling as though i can't talk to certain people, just because of their gender.
Its fucking lame, and i am kind of glad i don't have to live like that anymore.
Don't get me wrong, theres parts of of the relationship i had that i miss, 
more than anything. The promises for the future, The love we shared, 
that seemed to slowly slip away. Just so many little things ill miss.
Like someone telling me i am the most beautiful when i first wake up, 
or someone that wants to marry me, someone who loves me more than anything
in the whole entire world. Someone who isn't afraid of the future. Someone who isn't going to 
go nuts, and turn into something that isn't who they actually are. It hurts alittle. 
But the pain will slowly go away. To be replaced with love, from my family. 
And someone whose worth my time. Hopefully everything just works out for the better.
Well. thats all i have to say for now. I want my happiness back. And i hope its something
i can get back sooon.
