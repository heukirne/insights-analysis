i ask myself how i stumbled upon this mess and the truth is i didnt. its a sorry way of evading a problem. to blame it on circumstance when in actuality it was entirely orchestrated by me is both pathetic and deceitful. so today i'm going to acknowledge it. i am going to face up to the fact that all this clutter and disarray was a long time coming. i'm going to finally open my eyes to the glaring fact that i have to get rid of all this dysfunction if my life is ever going to work.

i've accused those around me of denial when i've been guilty of the exact same thing. its terrible because i wish i reached this realisation earlier. it's too late now and there is nothing to do but pick up the pieces and move the fuck on. it's spilt milk and i have to live with the consequences of that. i am going to make the call later that will cement this decision and allow amends to be made.

i just feel so incredibly sorry. :(
