Free to be the person i've always wanted to be. 
Free from dealing with the shit you've always handed me. 

Its funny how i felt like i could love you so much.
always looked into your eyes and saw the worlddd.
Now all i see is someone who failed to protect me. 

Someone who never loved me enough.
And someone who will never be good enough.
You Could give me all the money in the world.
But it honestly wouldnt buy me back.

I am finally free to live in this world made for me. 
And i have no intentions
Of falling back into you.
