Some things that working on 1920 street has made me realise and/or wonder about:

1. Do people really need to be entertained all the time? Yes, apparently they do. People come into the hotel and are appalled when they find out that the rooms do not have televisions. They demand to know if there are events at night. "What is there to do?" They cry. Oh, I don't know, you could try reading a book, sleeping--I'd recommend love-making, but make sure it's between the sheets because the comforter isn't dry cleaned after every visitor, or you could always talk to each other. 
2. Is it because I have said I don't like actors that I am now continually surrounded by them? I am now starting to grow fond of actors, or these actors at the very least. I even danced the Charleston with the actors that came in today. The gay actors, of which there are plenty, are very good-looking, so maybe I can introduce them to the newest gay in my life...   
3.  Work, at least here is about as fun as you choose to make it.  The front desk manager can be a bit of a negative Nancy and things never seem to go well for her. This is the kind of place that you have to relax and accept that bad things are going to happen sometimes. People are going to screw up and you might even ruin a wedding or two in your lifetime.
