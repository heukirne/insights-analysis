Some of the things I want to do and jobs I would like to have:

Do postgraduate studies and maybe even get a PhD.
Get at job at either DFAT, AusAID or Department of Immigration and get posted overseas.
Work for an NGO.
Work for the RSPCA.
Go back to uni and get a completely different degree to my current one (Art School, Science?).
Design and make clothes.
Open my own store.
Work with Indigenous Australians.
Act on stage.


I hope I do at least one of them. I hope I'm not too lazy.
