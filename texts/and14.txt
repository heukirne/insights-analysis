I'm still stuck in monday. My brain isn't working right.

I absolutely cannot stand toughness. I cannot stand fighting.
I HATE people who have nothing better to do than get ANGRY and bitch and moan and threaten to fight people.
I hate MEN.
I hate WOMEN.

I JUST FUCKING HATE IT.

I refuse to feel like I am back in high school (fuck, this didn't even happen to me in high school because I wasn't this fucking immature).
I DON'T CARE.
DON'T INVOLVE ME.
DON'T BITCH TO ME, DON'T BITCH THROUGH ME.

As much as I like this person, I am not sticking around for this bullshit.

GET OVER YOURSELVES YOU FUCKING IGNORANT, VILE, PATHETIC EXCUSES FOR HUMAN BEINGS.

Seriously don't you have a life?
