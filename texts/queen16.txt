I just got back from my doctor and apparently I have some form of bronchitis. It's kind of frustrating that I've been diagnosing myself lately, and I feel more like my doctor just agrees with me. Actually the one time I went for my ear infection, I really thought he should have given me ear drops visit one. Nope. Lo and behold, I wasn't any better and a week later I came back the Tuesday later still in extreme pain. He gave me antibiotic ear drops. He checked my ears today. Lo and behold, my ears looked excellent! Anyway, I think I caught it early enough it shouldn't be too hard to get rid of it. I'm on Z-PAC, the super antibiotic now, so I’m really hoping I start to feel better pretty soon. I hate missing work. Probably at any other place of employment when teachers are so sick and feel like they need to call off, they probably are allowed to lay around and rest in peace so they can get better. Not where I work. I follow all the call-off procedures, and instead I get phone calls and e-mails that I didn't post plans on the network drive, which I needed to do today but I cannot access the network drive from home e-mail access. Well... what do you expect me to do about it from home? Oh, and no offense I've left detailed plans before and 9/10 never have a substitute, so it all feels like a waste. The two times I had a substitute, and I laid everything out, she decided to do something completely different with the kids (probably because the woman who is assigned to be me, no offense, wasn't smart enough to review a basic step-by-step phonetics lesson. Remember crazy, "I lost my camera because you let a student steal it" lady? Yeah, I think I've proven my point...). At or away from work, the torture awaits. Is teaching here or another inner city school two more years worth $17,500 in student loan payback? That is the question that will be lingering with me a long, long time... I'm off to expel some of this anger in a video game. Ciao...
