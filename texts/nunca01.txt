
oh God. I cannot even believe this is really true. You know that story circulating in the news about the woman who ran over her son with her SUV? I know that kid. His name was Sam. He went to Prairie and was in the aftercare last year. I cannot believe he is gone. That wonderful child has no future. I can't even wonder what possessed his mother. I cannot even pay attention to that right now. I am completely traumatized to know that a child I personally worked with is gone. To know and think of how completely terrified his last moments on earth were. To realize that I thought he would grow up to be class clown because he was so funny and got fussed at so much. But he was still such a great kid. I really cannot even fathom this information. My hope and faith in God is incredibly high. All I can wish is that God was with him in every way on his last moments in this world. I cannot believe that wonderful child... I am so overthrown and my heart has jumped from my toes to my throat.

It is a tragedy. My prayers are with you, Sam. May you rest in peace.
