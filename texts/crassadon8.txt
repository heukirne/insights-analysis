It's my birthday today. . I haven't had a fun birthday in a decade. . I plan to watch cartoons. I'm trying to progress in my life, although I have no idea what it is I'm trying to do.

. . oh well.

I don't use livejournal much anymore. I. . .can't seem to complete an entry, and I don't seem to want to read anything, either. . . . I sure hope I start feeling more like myself, soon.
