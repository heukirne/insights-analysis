The fire over the hill is creeping closer and closer...no threat to good ol' Palmdale but it may cut off the freeway. The sky has been orange for 2 days and I had to sweep away the ashes that were covering the front walk and driveway. Nasty! I hope that Gwen and I can get through tomorrow for her biofeedback appointment.
