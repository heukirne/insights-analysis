Me: Do you think my legs look fat?
Mom: *glances over* Yes.

Me: Well I was really fat at the beginning of the summer, and now I think I'm slightly less fat. But still fat.
Dad: Mhmmmmm.

Me: I'm so full.. I feel so fat...
Mom: Well didn't I tell you not to finish off the rice?

Like a breath of fresh air, parents are the only people who tell it like it is.

(Can't even mention the word "fat" in front of friends because they start going on a rampage about how I'm not fat and should eat however much I like. While giving me disapproving looks whenever I eat less than I usually do as they go off eating their bite-sized portions. I don't understand... please just let me use the term "fat" out of convenience at least.)
