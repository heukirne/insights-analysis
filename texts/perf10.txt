1) "Big Bang Theory" is terrible. I put it on in the background so I wouldn't miss "How I Met Your Mother" and now the MUTE button is my friend.
2) I ordered vegan brownies off of Etsy. They looked YUM - I hope that turns out to be prophetic.
3) I've been educating myself on some broad outlines of European history as it pertains to King Henry the Eighth. You know, so I can put all the shagging in "The Tudors" into context.
4) I've mapped out a nice four mile walk around the eastside.
5) I'm looking forward to delving into Dad's papers tomorrow.
6) I spent an hour in Swan Point Cemetery today, eating lunch and bill-paying. I just needed to get OUT of the house - and it is so lovely there.
7) Oh, thank god, "HIMYM" is on.
8) I am still learning how to set boundaries - it feels good
9) I am also still obsessed with the evolution/creationism debate. 
10) Yay! The local CD shop is putting on their disks on sale for $9.99. I bought The Pierces, Charlotte Sometimes and U2.
