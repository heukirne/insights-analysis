It's difficult to explain to somebody how regardless of how happy and beautiful your life can be, you can still have deep seeded thoughts of sadness and urges to abuse yourself, I get alot of "it was a long time ago", "your a strong person", "don't let it worry you" but its never that simple.

I replay incidents in my head from my childhood and examine them and try to figure out if it was abusive and to what level, I also sit and try to remember parts from the great blank periods of my childhood, I worry that there's events which Ive blocked out which are significant to how I'm feeling.

I do this because I still struggle to accept what happened to me, I struggle to accept that I wasn't to blame and that there isn't something evil or wrong with me to have forced my family to do this to me, I think if it had of only been one it would have been easier but because it was three members, i'm the common factor its more reasonable to blame me.

Also just as you are taught to walk, eat, tie your shoe laces, I was taught that I wasn't good enough from birth and trying to unlearn that is as hard as asking you unlearn how to say your own name, you can ignore it but that information is always going to be there.

I need a reason to feel unhappy like this, I'm fat so I can blame that for these feelings, rather then remembering why.

At this point I don't know how to move on, I just keeping trying a little bit day by day and hope one day it clicks and this burden is lifted.
