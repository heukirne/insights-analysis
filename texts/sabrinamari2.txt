I want to write about my trip later today, but first I want to comment about the classes I am taking with Caroline Kenner.

This weekend was the third monthly class of twelve, and we as a group are beginning to journey in overlapping ways and develop a group mind. Listening to Caroline's comments is tremendously useful, as she has an immense store of knowledge and a tender heart to share with us.

Listening to everyone's journeys is a powerful experience, and I find that it's as valuable as exploring my own. I'm also enjoying the pleasure of staying the night before at Caroline and Jason's place---the company is wonderful and Jason is always willing to share his newest tarot decks, a practice which teaches me unexpected and delightful lessons every time.

I'm starting to encounter entirely new spiritual paradigms because of these classes---a side effect of working this path that I did not necessarily expect. And to my joy, Cat and Vicki are there beside me walking the path.

Right now, I have the best of two worlds: new ideas and people to learn from and play with, and long-time friends I love and trust with whom to share the journey. I am very grateful!

I resisted these classes for a long time, and I'm mostly there because of Caroline's cleverly executed bait-and-switch, which lured me into healing and growth by promising me intellectually-based knowledge. Now I'm shaking my head in surprise, grateful that I was called onto this path despite myself.

I must agree with the idea that for the most part, humans are very bad at predicting what will make them happy. That certainly seems to be true for me.
