We have, roughly, three different kinds of dishes:
white, thrift-store-bought plates and bowls for everyday use;
a few beloved antique pieces of china and glass inherited from family;
and
a handful of rustic, hand-made pottery either made by me, made by friends or bought from local artists.

I've decided that, as I slide inexorably towards forty, I MIGHT COULD replace the cupboard full of mismatched thrift store stuff with an actual SET of dishes that are meant to go together and on which I could serve a whole dinner party. I'd like for them to be able to go with either the antiques or the handmade stuff (not at the same time, of course), so I'm eyeballing these:

I think they could go either way - traditional, fancy; or a little rustic. What do you all think?

[edit: they also come in a pale sage green or white... tho i must say, the buttery yellow spoke to me]
