going to a con. . . I feel, possibly more prepared than I've ever been for a con before, but I'm not expecting to enjoy it very much.

My depression has become quite bad. I trudge forward, forcing myself to do the right things, yet I feel like I'm becoming sadder. I always seem to be frowning, and it's weird because I remember when I would never frown. . I really feel that I'm becoming more depressed over time. I'm being hopeful. . I don't have very many more ideas for things to try.
