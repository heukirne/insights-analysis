I surprise myself every day. not only have i been cleaning everything in this house and trying to cook for myself but i've been doing little things that make me notice I've really been being an adult. Or at least that I could be if I tried. I'm absolutely exhausted but it's okay. Last week I kind of ignored school because I was thinking too much about boys. but this week i'm going to try way harder. mostly, i noticed last night that while i wanted so bad to get mad and to act like a retard and make it obvious that i wanted attention and that I was kind of jealous and things like that, I think I handled it very well. I tried my best to just walk away and go to someone else. I didn't rant. I didn't take it out on her. I just told myself it's not even that big of a deal and if you just pretend you didn't even notice everyone will think you're way cooler than that. And that if I acted like a bitch or like it bothered me they would think I was pathetic. and you know what? it totally may have worked. Other than my slight jealousy there was absolutely no drama. I even had fun. Idk why this probably seems dumb to anyone reading this but I am just really proud of myself for all the little things. it's really good to know that when I can no longer count on my parents for everything, I'll be able to do it. The only matter now is finding a real adult job.
