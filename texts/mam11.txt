I am feeling better than I ever have in my life; its as if all the puzzle pieces have started making sense. The puzzle hasn't come together yet but there aren't anymore peices that belong to other people (parental types, bosses, etc) and all they are all turned over so I can see the design and colors. Yep, its been a long time coming.

My biggest worry is the hormone induced insomnia; sleep being one of my hobbies, its difficult when I can't pursue it. Other things get in the way of naps, too, like work, tending to Gwen, this baby shower thing we all have to attend for Theresa....

I was approached by the owner of an agency to discuss creating a mental health componant to their foster care program. Cool! I like the idea but I don't know what to do...maybe I'll talk it over with Larry. He's created things like this in his day and knows what to include and what to leave out; don't reinvent the wheel, Jo.

I want to mostly be able to work, make the world a better place in my own little ways, contribute to my family's financial wellbeing, and have fun. Maybe collaborating with this agency will let me do what I want for the rest of my years here in So. Cal.

Off to paint a fence...I'm determined to get it done!
