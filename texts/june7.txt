I admit it.  I have ADD. Or something. Every time I think about coming back to a "series" or a planned journal entry, I sigh a bit inside. I'm just not that interested in the past things, although I definitely need to be more disciplined in my processing of events, conferences, and such. I guess it is that by the time I get to writing, I'm already thinking/reading/talking about something else, so to write about the past seems like going backwards for me. This is so ironic, if you think of it, because I feel like history (of all types, national, personal, global, etc.) has huge implications on our present and future. It tells us where we've been, shows us the possibility of where we're going, and gives us lessons to follow for the present. Why, just yesterday I was reading an essay on friendship that was written in the 1600's and I found it to be as true today as then.

So, when I think of updating and then remember that i've promised to continue talking about TGE (as wonderful as it was), I just feel unmotivated. Because what if I want to talk about Preaching Reimagined, the book I'm reading right now, or my house and the projects that are going on, or anything else? 

And right now, I'm bored with the computer and just want to hang with the family. So, I'll write about other stuff later :)
Happy New Year, all.
