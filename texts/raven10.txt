Well I went to my second interview and I was totally given the job. The problem being that both the Tim McGraw concert (which Bryan spent a butt load of money on for both Dayna and I to go) and the trip up north with his family (which if I miss I will nto get to do again because they are selling their property. This is a good bye/get anything that is ours that is still up there trip) fall on the training time. That is it only pays minimum wage...and if you aren't a crazy aggressive salesperson you will most likely get laid off. O_O. Totally misleading from the first interview. She made it sound on the phone like there were a ton of positions available. Nope...only this one now. And I got the impression you made mroe money than that. Granted...if you're good on sales you can make $1000 a month comission. But I am not pushy like that. 

Of course, he said if there was another class after that one he would give me a call. That gives me more time to try and find a job. I wouldn't mind working at a call centre again but I do not want to rely on comission and I do not want any less than $10/hr. Might as well work at arby's otherwise. 

I cried like the whole way home too. I don't kjnow why really. I didn't even want the job that badly. I guess it just upsets me because not even a job like this could work out for me. Just have to try to remain positive and so on. 

Also, lately i have been getting nasty headaches and feeling sick. This is only now starting to worry me because of how frequently it has been going on.
