It's like this is a drug which I know I should quit but never can.
I was going straight for 2 months, and now I am back in the deep end and loving every second of it.

Just give it 3 days.
I will be empty. Confused. Anxious. Angry.
The worst kind of withdrawals.

"You're like my own personal brand of heroin."


Yes, you are.


I was stupid and foolish to get back into this again.
But I am a little bit addicted.


Man, I have to quit you.
