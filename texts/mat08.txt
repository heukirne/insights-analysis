So I finally gave in and made a facebook. I've got japans kitty cat at my house, and I absolutely love it, she cuddles me while I sleep. It makes me feel really comfortable having her there <3 I absolutely adore kitties. My school plans have changed a little bit. Back to fashion design as a past time. My mom says that I'll get better financial aid if I wait til next year, so I'm going to do the smart thing and listen to her. She said if I keep my nose clean for the time being grandpa shutan will help me out. I feel like I'm becoming more of an adult, and more mature with every day that passes. I feel like I'm human again. ^_^
