1) "Fringe" makes me happy. It's fun and spooky, but not challenging. Stylish and creepy, comforting. And - bonus - Eric is still at a meeting, so no sneering about Joshua Jackson's acting :-)
2) Still feeling great from my afternoon walk. All the flowering trees are blooming - the smell is heady!
3) I've an idea for my houses that I think is workable - and cool.
4) Happy, sleepy cats. They sleep with such ABANDON, totally vulnerable.
5) I love those earth-toney Sharpies they developed a few years ago.
6) Blueberry preserves. YUM. And tonight, blueberry preserves with cottage cheese.
7) Evo-devo - how exciting!
8) Finished Jonathan Frantzen's "The Corrections" two days ago. What a terrific novel!
9) Topo maps also make me happy
10) Skeptical Inquirer has an interesting article on pseudo-science in the field of nutrition.
