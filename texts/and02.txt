I've spent the past two days watching the OC in my room.
And msging Roman blergh he doesn't get what is going on.
And getting wonderful msgs from Lukey about the photo I sent him with his t-shirts.
Man I miss him so so much. I wish he would stop saying all these amazing things which make me like him even more.

It is still killing me not seeing him.

I know I should just let it go and not kid myself that anything real will happen. But for some reason I can't.

I keep forgetting he has this whole different life which I have nothing to do with.
He doesn't share too much with me so I never know what's going on with him.
And I'm not saying that that he should, we're not super close or anything.
But I always feel like I want to tell him everything that is going on with me. I want him to be my person.

I guess I've just got to face the fact that I like him more than he likes me.
But mainly that he his going through alot at the moment. I can't begin to imagine what goes on in his head. I just want him to be happy.
Whether it's with me or not.
