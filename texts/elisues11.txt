i feel like in order to become a good person i have to make amends for the wrong i've done in the past? it's really tough cos i generally feel like there are all some people who still hold on to so much negativity when whatever happened happened way back when. but then again it's not really my place to say that so never mind. i have gone about apologising and seeking reconciliation with these people and some have been very forgiving which speaks volumes about the kind of people they are and I'm really appreciative of that.

i've internalised the fact that this might be misconstrued as selfishness on my part because it just seems like i want to feel better about myself. it's fine if people think that but i genuinely just feel like i've been going around shitting all over people thinking i could get away with it. and i did, but its hardly the accountable thing to do and i just think that if i genuinely want to become the kind of man i am to be that all this clutter needs to be first cleared.

i feel like i've had to swallow my pride with all these apologies i've been making and its really weird cos i've never felt like such a walkover before. is this what being nice and docile is like? i feel like i want to be a good person but not at the expense of being so bland and obliging i disappear, haha.

on a side note, renjie told me some scintillating news today which i will not let him forget for a very long time to come. florence is clearly where it's at hahahahaha <33
