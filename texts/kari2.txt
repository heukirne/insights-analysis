Things up lately:

Well, I'm doing alright. I'm about to get hired on fulltime at UTP (Universal Turbine Parts!)I believe. It's a very good company, good coworkers, and good job. I am so extremely happy to have gotten this job; honestly, I can't even explain just how lucky I am to have gotten it. 

Anxiety is kind of bad, usually about 3/5 days of the workweek are fulldays of bad anxiety, usually with one day where I'm fine, and a day where I'm floating back and forth. Even so, I've been able to keep it kept down. 

I'm going to a concert this coming Thursday with my closest friend down here, and meeting up with a friend in Augusta GA and his girlfriend for it, and then heading out to Atlanta during Friday to do some shopping, and then coming back to Montgomery for another concert that night with my friend. Should be fun :)
