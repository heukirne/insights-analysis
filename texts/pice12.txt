"till now I always got by on my own,
I never really cared until I met you.
Alone." -- Anne Wilson of Heart

Alone,
is where i long to be.
Alone,
I hate the feeling
Alone.

The damage was done so long ago.
The wounds repaired,
Until that unfaithful bullet broke blood twice over.
Stitches disrepair.

Alone.
This is me, destined to be,
Alone.
Trapped in this unremitting universe
Alone.

Headed to the breakdown,
Vodka is my meltdown.
Quench this thirst for a shadow of hurt.
Hiding from the other face of two faces.

Alone.
My own worst enemy.
Alone.
Two disembodied
Alone.
