yesterday I discovered the best store ever! it's this outdoor fabric store, and they had hooks and D-rings for helluh cheap, so I bought alot of them, and four yards of zipper. I'm so excited for school, all I can think about is all the new outfits to make. I almost finished one today, and it looks very cool and professional. I've gotten so much better at sewing than when I first started. I'm really satisfied with what I made today, and I'm uber excited to make my new jacket. And school shouldn't be too far off now. Life is going very good.
