with every day that passes, I feel better and better, but I still feel worse and worse. I'm moving on with my life finally. It's weird not having you here, but I'm trying to help myself move on, because I know that the road me and you would walk down would part eventually. It's so hard to do, but I think I might be doing it okay. I guess I'm sorry too. Sorry it has to be this way.
