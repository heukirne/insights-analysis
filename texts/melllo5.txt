 i havent updated in a bit, 
for various reasons.
ive been okay. just living out my life.
one day at a time.
for once in my life i feel content, with what i have, where i am going, and my friends.
i feel like this is how everything is supposed to be. 
i am finally happy for once.
theres no way any of it is going to get messed up either.
its perfect.


i dont know what else to write.
so i think ill just go for now.
