Sunday was MUCH lazier than Saturday. I woke up super early to get the laundry going, empty waste baskets and wash dishes; but after that, it was channel surfing all the way. I ditzed around online, watched The Soup, herded cats (just as difficult as the aphorism says), read a little of my library book and generally vegged out.

In the late afternoon, we headed over to some friends' house to celebrate one of their graduations :-) Eric made a really tasty fiddlehead and butter bean cassoulet to take to the potluck. YUM.

While there I chatted with new people, acquaintances and friends. There were lots of lively conversations, friendly debates, kids running in and out, delicious food... just terrific.

We came home on the early side, risked brain damage and moral turpitude by watching "Daisy of Love" and fell into bed. ZZZzzzzzz...
