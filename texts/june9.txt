I have experienced a lot of very cool things in my life...more than most South Dakotans, I would venture. I've been to the top of the World Trade Center AND prayed with people on the street just months after 9/11. I've driven over the golden gate bridge, climbed Cape Perpetua in Oregon, and watched the sunset on the Chesapeake Bay. I've sailed in the Missouri River and swum in the Columbia River. I've seen an eagle swoop down and pluck up a fish from the Pactola Resevoir and watched a moose amble through the Boulder River valley.  I've had dim sum in NYC with my mom's criminal justice geeks and I've had fine french cuisine (and the most expensive wine!) in Montreal with geniuses in the ethanol industry. 

Last night, I added another fantastic experience. I watched Elton John play piano and sing from some suprisingly good cheap seats cuddled up next to Joe. Although he must have played those songs a million times, as I watched his hands move over the keyboard, it was as though he was creating them new just for us. (and indeed, in reality, he was). I spent time completely enthralled with every movement, and I spent time with my eyes closed. I even answered a few texts and took some pictures. In general, I just tried to be all there with Joe. I miss a lot of life by worrying and fretting and being botherered and upset and frustrated and confused and wow wouldn't that be the easiest work the devil/evil spirits/whatever has to do? Just distract us from actually LIVING? I hope to write more about this, but the book Praise Habit has been saying that, what I already know....to just LIVE! Put on Christ as our habit, our hope, our covering, and just LIVE. I think way too damn much haha.

Anyways, it was an awesome concert.
