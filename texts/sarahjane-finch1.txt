Im stunned to have further news of my friend who was found dead, he killed himself by slashing his wrists open and then stabbing himself into the heart.
I just can't believe that he couldn't reach out to any of his close friends, he was loved by us all and loved life so greatly and passionately, why would he do this?

He would give advice on love, on people, on society and people would sit and listen and be amazed by his in depth knowledge and understanding of life and the world.

He touched so many peoples hearts, you only ever had to meet him once to be blown away by his passion for life, then why did he do this?? What was so bad in the world.

I know I shouldn't be angry but I am, he opened my mind and my heart and I feel betrayed.
Everything he's ever said is a lie, to kill himself the way he did he must have been hurting so badly, he must have wanted no possibility of recovery.
He was a physiotherapist, he had an in-depth knowledge of the body, he knew exactly what he was doing, its so hard to know that it wasn't a cry for help, that he didn't want to harm himself.

He wanted to die, he wanted to make sure that the outcome was his own death in a painful and physically aggressive way.

I look down at my own wrists and can't imagine how difficult it would be to slash them from wrist to elbow ans then take that knife and puncture my own chest cavity. Why
