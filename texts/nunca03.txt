gahhhh. i wanted someone to like but i don't think i could. i will probably be alone forever. the truth is. no matter how much he hurts me and how idiotic he is and no matter how much i love to make fun of him for some retarded reason i think even though i tell myself not to go back to him i probably always will until i find someone to fall in love with. yeah, i don't get it either. i'm an idiot. what's so appealing about a jackass? nothing that's what. but whatever. the point is i feel bad now. all that thinking and it was the same all along. i feel bad cuz he deserves someone nice but i just don't think i could. i'm not quite sure why. but anyway. i'm just praying that the day will come when jared comes back. i wish i would run into him randomly and he would see me and be like OMG that girl fineee she must have matured a lot and he would be the one because he was pretty damn awesome. haha

butttt idk. whatever. i need to clean my room and do hw. i don't wanna. whatever....again
