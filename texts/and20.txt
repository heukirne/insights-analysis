I'm not sure if I like being single or if I am just too tired to care.

I have let my heart be broken so many times.

Something happened which I had wanted to happen since I was 16. I enjoyed it. I was embarrassed about it. Mostly I wish I hadn't done it. Some things are better when they are unknown.

I got to the point where I hadn't made a conscious decision to stop getting involved with people. I had simply run out of energy. My heart couldn't take any more pain and had quietly turned itself off. I started to think it would just be better to be single. To be alone and uncomplicated and free.

So now I can't tell if I am being lazy or if I am doing the wrong thing. I am not excited about this boy like I used to get, but is that because I have turned into a cynical, boring person or because it's not meant to happen?

I am terrified I am going to hurt him, all because I could not be bothered to work out how I feel.

I am a slave to the neverending human need for affection. And I hate myself for it.
