From the minute we first met
You crushed me
... and I crushed you
It was then I knew

One more tear
and you're not here
One more year
These words I can't stand to hear

I will, I will (I will...) try!
I will, I will (I will...) not cry.
I will, I will (I will...) fly
I will, I will (I will...) not lie
to myself anymore.

and I've gotta get away,
packed my bags,
not looking back today.
and I've gotta get away,
The people of this town,
keep leading me astray.

So...
I will, I will (I will...) try!
I will, I will (I will...) not cry.
I will, I will (I will...) fly
I will, I will (I will...) not lie
to myself anymore.
[whispering]:
I will, I will, I will ... fade out.
