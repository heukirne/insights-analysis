You're running around trying to get somewhere, when deep down inside you have no idea where you actually want to go. You're shooting bullets in the dark at a target you don't know anything about. I'm not saying I do, but I honestly don't need to know, because I don't feel the need to shoot. You'll run and run and run to find that ten years down the road, when your stupid plan runs out, you're still just going to be sitting there, wondering to yourself ,"what next"? Working so hard towards a future that you've forgotten about the present. There will always be things you forget about believing in. There is no happiness where ever you are, unless you can become a happy person. You'll just sit there, playing your life out, because you feel like if you're doing something than you've accomplished something. Nobody cares what you accomplished when you're dead. You don't even give two shits once you're dead. You might as well make the life you can right? I don't really care, you can hop from one shithole to the next to find you're not content with any of them, because you honestly don't know what you want. What you need is to stop saying there's something better, because there's not. This is the story of your life, and it's not depressing, and it's not happy, and it doesn't matter what you do during your life, because you're going to die at the end anyways.
