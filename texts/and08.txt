I'm trying trying trying at uni.
I think I have it under control.

Not having a job sucks.


I miss him. As a friend. As a lover. As the first person I want to tell about things that happen to me. I miss trying to figure him out. I miss getting frustrated with how slow and indecisive he is. I miss being blown away by how strong and honest he is. I miss trying to catch a peek when he is getting changed. I miss the butterflies I get when he opens his front door. I miss feeling safe and happy and finally ok with the world. I miss him more than I had imagined.

And this time is different because I really do think I fell in love with him. The lust made me panicky and nervous and jealous. Love makes me sad and lonely and utterly heartbroken.

His happiness matters more to me than my own.
It tears me apart.
