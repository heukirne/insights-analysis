adio Rivendell is an awesome site for mood setting while roleplaying. The only thing I have against it is that because it is all at random and you can't control what you listen to you something have epic battle scenes when you are simply in a bar enjoying a pint and vice versa! lol. But I don't really know how to avoid that on a radio site.
