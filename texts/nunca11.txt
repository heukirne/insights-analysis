I never think anyone's good enough, but I always give him another chance. Even though he doesn't deserve it. I'm strong enough to deal with all the bullshit now. I don't know what his problem is. I just know that he has some aversion to anything going wrong in life. I'm not sure. But I'm strong enough to deal with all of that now, but I'm too weak to stay away from him. I have no self control when it comes to him yet I have to because things are going to be different with my life in general now. I'm growing up for once. I can handle it. I can't guarantee I won't fall apart a few times. But I can guarantee that I will try with all my heart because I know what I want and I'm going to get it.My way or no way.
