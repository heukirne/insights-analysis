I'm trying to grow up. I'm trying to get out of the whole that is my life. I'm trying to throw everything that is me out the window. I'm growing up, and trying to become more mature of a person. I think I might throw everyone aside that will hold me back. I'm going to try not to do any illegal activity. I'm going to attempt to throw my drinking to the side completely, it can't make me a better person, and it destroys everything about me that is abstract. I'm constantly looking for anything that can be me. I don't want to be different from anyone else, and I'm not trying to be the same, I'm just trying to find self definition through everything I can be, and can become. I've recently come to the conclusion that I hate everything. I hate the people I've surrounded myself with, I hate my ex girlfriend, I hate my job, I just hate myself. It's all because I've put myself into a position where there's no way that I can be happy. The only obstacle that I'll ever have to overcome is myself. The only person who can make me happy is me. I've always known this, but lately, my pot has just been boiling over. I've been completely holding back flipping out so many times recently. Until I destroy myself I can't be better. I'm fucking worthless. I'm a two bit nobody going nowhere right now. My boat is just slowly rocking more and more, and it's waiting to tip over. I've just become so unhappy with myself, and it's breeding more unhappiness. I'm not saying I've got any kind of redemption, or any more knowledge than I've had before. I don't even know why I'm writing this, because I still know, very very soon, I'm going to flip the fuck out, and I'm going to throw and break things, and I'm going to cry, and I'm going to scream at the top of my lungs, and after all of this... after all of this, I'm going to feel better about myself.
