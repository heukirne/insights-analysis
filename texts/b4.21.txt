Jason and Rob are discussing sports I think that I may learn from osmosis. At my place, sports is the default channel. That's not by my choice. I don't really find sports interesting. Sometimes, but not often. Sports games have become annoyingly realistic. Sort of a "I can't believe it's not sports!" type of thing.

Quite frankly I haven't really sat down to write anything for a while. I've done some scribbles here and there but nothing that would constitute a writing session. Sometimes, I just need to remember how good for my mental health writing is.
