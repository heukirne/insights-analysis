So, tomorrow (actually technically today), I'm leading a breakout session at the best women's conference ever: Nevertheless . It's the first of an annual conference to be held in our area. Tonight was the first night and it was amazing already. Thoughtful, passionate worship (including a song written just for us!), an amazing and thought-provoking talk from Erin (about passion, of course :), and sushi and cheesecake at the after-party. Just for interestingness, I'm going to post the outline for my session. I won't be necessarily tied to this outline, as I'm hoping the discussion will go where it may. But these are a few of my thoughts on "The Dark Side of Girl World". Let me know what you think!
