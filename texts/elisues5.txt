see, the problem with all of this is that no one can take a look at anyone and see them for who they really are. this inevitably results in the mirage effect. people take a glance at the first impression i put forth and assume i am all vanilla but the moment they get closer they realise what an abyss of dysfunction my soul actually is.

what further perpetuates the problem is that i am more than comfortable with only letting on the best of me when it is quite essentially just a roundabout way of lying. it's only when i get tired of maintaining the facade that the cracks start to show and they ask me why i've suddenly turned cold. that question is unfortunately inapplicable because the aloofness i suddenly embody wasn't so much a paradigm shift as the unravelling of my true self.

i am incapable of care or concern. i am incapable of emotion. i've been cocooned by the tribulations of life into a hardened pod and unless someone has the strength to rip that to shreds with their bare hands, i will never be free.
