Recently, I've been toying with the idea to visit the school counselor and simply pour out all my thoughts. I tried it once before for an entirely different issue, and all that did for me was show me how unhelpful it was - going to a counselor is not going to solve all of life's problems. So I'm kind of wary. Is it worth feeling vulnerable and exposed? Is it worth hoping to find someone you trust, but getting your hopes crushed? Worst of all - will I be labeled as "anxious" and shoved pills? I can picture the file they'll have at hand for me. "Chief Complaint: anxiety." Silly counselor, it's not anxiety, don't put a label on me. Don't give me a medical condition. I just want someone to talk to who can empathize with me and help me.

In the near future, when I'm not in the middle of finals week, I'll try posting about my problems. To sum it up though: boyfriend - friends - insecurity - medical school.

I don't understand how a year made such a difference in my mental health. How long do I have to wait for things to get better?
