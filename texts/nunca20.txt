i am so confused as of late. things are starting to bother me again.
for whatever reason, my heart hurts. i'm not sure why. but everything just squeezes at it. i think the simple act of remembering how badly it hurts to be rejected or be alone... i usually just suppress the feelings of loneliness. but when there's a possibility of liking someone and it being taken away so often... everything worries me... i want something to happen. i want the simple speck of hope that there MIGHT be someone not completely ridiculous and retarded out there who might want to be with me. i want God to do SOMETHING to prove to me that i will not die alone without having loved. even though i'm supposed to know that, it hurts too much not to have hope. i guess it's incredibly unchristian of me...but God doesn't seem like enough hope sometimes. as much as i know he is there... i think the hard part is trying to know that he is not going to let me be miserable or unhappy. i just can't believe that Godly love is the only kind necessary to be happy. I just have such hope for romantic love. and I prayed so much this week. and I was supposed to go to church today especially to try to stay in God's good graces. but i didn't. burned that bridge.

i sound psychotic, I'm sure. but you know...

also... is it wrong of me to be bothered by the fact that my bf is acting like she has known my ex for years and is commenting him on facebook telling him she loves him? like... sorry... idk. i'm just retarded.

and feel like crying. as always.
