unfortunately I am looking into getting a studio apartment. i cannot put up with anyone else and i can't afford an actual bedroom. i need to get the hell out of here. i cannot go anywhere on spring break. i knew if i didnt do whatever my mom wanted to do today on her day off she would bitch about me not wanting to spend time with her. then she didn't do ANYTHING. i wasted an entire day. when i said i wanted to go out she told me no. she always says she never tells me no. i need to get out of here.
after last week i know i can do what it takes to live alone...the thing i'm not sure about is the job and the money thing. if i move out i'll probably have to pay for insurances. also i have birth control, other medicines, proactive, contacts, and bare minerals. how am i going to afford all of that? crap. plus the car insurance, gas, and my phone bill.
luckily with a studio apartment its 375 or 395 a month and it includes electricity and i believe water. i think i have a lot of the stuff i'd need already. i e-mailed to request a floor plan. i think the cheaper one is 200 square feet and the bigger is 250. i'd prefer the bigger but we'll see. i hope they will let me get one without credit.
i was going to go spend a lot of money but fuck that now.

ill probably have to get a smaller bed and might not be able to fit any of the stuff i rly want to in there. esp not my bookshelf. there's a lot of stuff i won't necessarily have to bring with me. but i will prolly still need a lot of storage. =[ i wanna see the place NOW i don't think i can wait.

must.get.out.of.here.
