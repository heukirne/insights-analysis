I have lexapro.

I don't know if I want to take it. I've been good lately, really good, and while the anxiety is still there, I'm not sure I want to go on an SSRI which will probably end up plummeting my sex drive. Hell, I think the frequent sex (1-3x day) has done more for me than anything.

However, the anxiety is still there. Honestly, I'd rather just have ativan to take when needed, but I really don't want to make it look like I'm drug-seeking as I am not.

Setting up a glucose tolerance test for next week and hopefully getting a gynecology appointment out of the way.
