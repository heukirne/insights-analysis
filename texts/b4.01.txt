I'm surrounded by the awful sounds of children crying. Wah wah waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Just another wedding at the Hotel. 

It's a dry wedding too. A dry wedding! I wouldn't want to be at a wedding if I couldn't drink; at least if the guests were my family. Of course I just mean that they are so much fun when they've been drinking--yeah, that's it.

This likely means that there are people with severe drinking problems and the bride and groom wanted to avoid the possibility of flasks. 
It’s a beautiful day today and probably a wonderful time to get married.
I’m really tired today—I worked at the hotel and Sorrentino’s last night so I was working from 7am to 11pm. Don’t feel too bad for me though because after that, I went out to a house party. It was fun!  Someone made an intricate pattern out of discarded nitrous oxide (N2O) containers. Boy, they must eat a lot of whipping cream at that house. And yet they are so thin…hmmm

Jason’s friend consumed 7 2CI  pills. I didn’t know that anyone could do that and live. I didn’t see him but I imagine he was sp 
Adrian and I walked home from the Kingsway back to whyte. It was a lovely walk. By the legislature grounds we tried to get sprayed by the sprinkler system but it shut off. I should have pushed him in the grass, next time.
