people say life is beautiful because of love and hope but i beg to differ. it's beautiful because of its irreversibility. there is infinite gravity in every second that we simply are and that is just the most amazing thing. i have always wished for a chance to turn back the clock, to rectify the past with a simple switch and do what i could have, should have or would have. however, that's not how time works and i have learnt to deal with that. i have learnt to appreciate the finality of my actions and thoughts, to see them as ends in themselves and to internalise the fact that once lost, little can be recovered. i do take time to mourn. i revel in misery and wail in anguish for all that was but will never be again. and then i stop, breathe, and get on with life because nothing costs more than wasted time.
