Knitting and crocheting a bunch lately :). It's so relaxing. Jonathan is still awesome. Driving daily. I need to practice more backing out and parking spaces and the three point turn since that's a big part of the test here, and then I should be set to try for my license. And then Jon and I cam hopefully take steps liiiiiike moving in together and such.

I am very happy.
