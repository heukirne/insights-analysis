So you may remember a blog around the beginning of September when I was talking about my old Religion teacher being arrested for indecent acts with a 14 year old. 

Well, he pleaded guilty yesterday, but it's even worse than originally reported.

Ick. He always was a slimy eel (see Grandma, I told you!)

My question is: where was the Catholic guilt? He sure was a self-righteous bastard.
