Was the first day in a long, while that i thought of you.
I thought of all the things you and i went through.
I thought of all the nights we spent having such an amazing time together.
I thought of everything we did together and how we were inseperable.
Then I looked down at lily.
And it almost put me to tears.
How hard i fought for something i knew wasn't right.
How long i tried to understand and make you see,
that the way your life is heading isn't good.

But its too late for all of that now.
There isn't a day that goes by that i don't think about you.
I wouldn't wish anything bad upon you.
No matter how wrong you treated me.
I Speak out of anger and frustration.

And i can only hope that you'll treat her 110% Better then how you treated me.
Shes a Young girl. And theres no way she'll be able to endure what you put me through.
Nobody should ever have too.
I wish i could just wipe you out of my life and never have to think about you.
It sucks that your always going to occupy that slot of time.
Its time i can't take back.
And its made me the way i am today.

Its built me up Into the Strong, capable, independent person i am today.
But i wish i didn't have to learn from the situations you put me in.
I'm Glad i am free to be myself again.
Love will Slowly be found.

But a hatred Like the kind i have for you will never, ever stop churning throughout my veins.
