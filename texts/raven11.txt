Lately I just feel like crap all the time. I can't sleep and even when I think I get enough sleep I sleep in every morning and still feel exhausted. I feel bored half the time and I think I am going stir crazy. Need a job wtf. Or a hobby. Or both. :( 

I was going to make a happier post about the last few days but really I just visited a few people, played some roleplay and then today I watched far too much Supernatural for my fragile mind to handle in one sitting. lol. I did get to see Lacie and Connor yesterday though which is always a bonus. Every time I see that kid I can't help but love him more. He is so awesome and so intelligent and just so amazing. He makes me uber proud to be an aunt...even if not official. But I have never been one to care about biological connections anyway. And of course. I heart my JOOP! lol

Over all though, just feeling down lately. Can't find a job and though I don't mind Arby's it doesn't pay enough. Nor does it give me enough hours. And the scheduling always sucks so I can't do a lot of the things I want to do. *sadface* And the closer and closer the wedding gets the more I freak out. I don't want to deal with any of this right now because it just stresses me out. Too much to coordinate and all that jazz. 

I will just concentrate on the pretty that is Dean Winchester. Mmmmmmm....Dean.
