I have been thinking about what I want to do with the rest of my life.

Instead of fearing the aging process, to my great surprise, I am excited and fascinated by what will happen next.

I feel good about aging, and about my prospects for happiness and meaning moving forward. This is very different from where I imagined I would be earlier in my life.

I'm not sure why I've developed this sense of my future.

Perhaps because I feel that I am on a good and right path?

Perhaps because the last few months have solidified an unexpected sense that my unconventional family is the perfect incubator for my happiness at this time?

Perhaps because it gets easier and easier to see the beauty that constantly surrounds me and the loving life that wants to enfold me?

Maybe I just feel good.

I don't know.

I simply know that I feel on track, full of trust, and able to walk towards joy.
