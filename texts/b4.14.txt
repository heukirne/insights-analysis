She’s not blonde hair blue eyed, her hair is brown and untidy. Sometimes, she wraps it up in a chic bun and then enchanting ringlets roll down to 
frame her heart shaped face. She’s not reed thin, she’s as curvy as the Dempster highway. She does not walk, she floats. She drinks habitually and if you go into her apartment on the weekend you might find her sniffing powder off of a key.

She falls in love quickly; one week it’s a stranger she met in a coffee shop and the next week it’s a sensitive, poor playwright. The only restriction she has is that they are never useful, she never falls in love with productive members of society.
     “It would probably take the romance out of it.” She told me when I questioned her choice of paramours.
