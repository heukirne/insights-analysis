Nokia Corporation is proud to announce its April edition of Nokia Connected Worlds. This will be a panel-style moderated discussion about perceptions of non-human avatars in virtual world business, so we welcome the audience to prepare questions for the panel to address. Feel free to send those questions to Hydra Shaftoe ahead of time in notecard form!
