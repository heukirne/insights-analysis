Woke up this morning and painted another layer on some houses until Eric started stirring. We returned our empties to the local soda plant (Yacht Club Soda) and bought a couple mixed six-packs. They use glass bottles and have old-fashioned flavors like birch beer and sasparilla. I love them. Then we dropped by the winter farmer's market in Pawtucket and picked up a few things, including lunch. After lunch we ditched the car at home and walked up to the nearest public library branch. The walk to and from the library felt so good! Eric and I haven't gone for a walk together in ages. 

Now he's peeling potatoes in front of the TV because they're playing LoTR again and we are hypnotized by it (nevermind that we own it on DVD, we still can't turn it off!)

We're headed off to a potluck this evening, but right now I am ensconced on the sofa with a stack of library books beside me. All those crinkly cellophane-covered dust-jackets in my hands reminds me of that feeling of endless possibility and unbridled joy I used to feel as a kid when we came from the library with a grocery sack full of books and a whole afternoon to spend with them...

What a nice day :-)


[edit: we were running behind schedule AND on-foot, so my haul wasn't as much as it could have been. I checked out: Richard Dawkins' "The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design," Tristram Stuart's "The Bloodless Revolution: A Cultural History of Vegetarianism from 1600 to Modern Times," Edward Humes' "Monkey Girl: Revolution, Education, Religion, and the Battle for America's Soul," and Kathy Reichs' 
Devil Bones" (A Temperance Brennan mystery).]
