Ummm....no. I am very firm in my belief that it shouldn't matter what you follow/if you go to church. It should only matter that you are a good person. I have always thought that if you are true to who you are you will go where you need to go if there is any after life. If there isn't well then it doesn't matter. But I am still going to have a good life and all that jazz. 

If this makes no sense I am sorry. Very tired. It doesn't make much sense to me and I am saying it lol!
