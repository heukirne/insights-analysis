After the hikes and rambles, Eric and I chilled at home, then headed out to The Patriot for a movie: Taken, with Liam Niesen. It was fairly terrible, but as we always remind one another, it WAS a buck-ninety-nine. And I got to hold hands with my sweetie in the dark :-)

We drove back home, ditched the car, and walked up to La Laiterie. Had a wonderful dinner. Now, I've had more amazing food elsewhere - but not by much. And the service there is absolutely pitch-perfect. Our server was Justin, who's the best server I've ever had anywhere. EVER. This dude makes me realize how much the service can make or break a meal. Eric and I shared an app (roasted aspargus with whipped ricotta) and salad (I wish I knew how to perfectly dress a salad) and roasted beets with kumquats and marscapone. I think. It all went by in a pleasant haze :-)
