Met a cool human being today. She's trained as both a quantitative and qualitative researcher and works with girls and women who get caught in the justice system. She's interested in how people transform out of stigmatizing identities (mental illness diagnoses, addiction, and incarceration), becoming new versions of themselves. This is pretty intriguing to me.

She said some really compelling things today that caught my attention during our brief conversation. I'm having lunch with her in a couple of weeks, and that gives me time to read some of her articles and think about them.
