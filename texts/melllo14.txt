
Your words disgust me. I read them and wish i hadn't.
I will never give you the satisfaction of telling you that its all okay.
because it isn't and it simply never will be.
I found someone that protects me.
And doesn't put me through situations like you did.
Love is grown, not found.
And that is simply something your disease infested mind will never grasp the concept of.
