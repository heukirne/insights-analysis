This semester will be different.






Indo was amazing. I can't wait to travel again. Now that I have the scary first time thing out of the way.

Uni this semester is better already. I am liking my courses a lot more. I have a lighter workload. I even feel better about being on campus. Slightly less paranoid and slightly more interested in all the babes haha.

I want so much to be happy.
And I know it will require a lot of effort. But I can't repeat last semester. That was horrible.



Also - I hate how there are these great tragic love stories about forbidden lovers who have no chance at happiness. But Arwen and Aragorn lived and died together. Romeo and Juliet died together. Bella and Edward lived forever together. None of those people just had to turn around and forget the other person and fall in love with someone else. They ended up together somehow.

I hate how in real life, love stories really never happen, even if they are supposed to.
Or maybe I just really want it to.
I have spent over a year having my heart broken.
I can't do this anymore.


I wish this was a great love story. It feels that way to me.
