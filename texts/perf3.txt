I find myself, as I do more often than not, having a good day. I've been working on another batch of little houses whilst watching Eugenie Scott testify in front of the Texas state school board on Youtube. I've already done my 3 mile walk with my tenant/friend, and now I'm drinking locally "brewed" grape soda and waiting for the glue on so many teeny tiny roofs to dry :-) More house batches are at various stages. I work too slow for my own taste, but... *shrug* I'm adopted a "whatever" attitude. I promised myself no work tonight, so I'm going to dive into that stack of books I accumulated over the weekend. I am a dull heroine, indeed :-)
