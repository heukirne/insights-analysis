I am trapped between two worlds, a part of both and yet not fully submerged in either one. One world is that of engineering and problem solving, my "vulcan" side. Even in relationships, I am almost fully capable of separating emotion from fact and coldly evaluating a situation. (a characteristic which I have been slowly realizing leaves me handicapped if I don't also understand the emotion) Working with engineers (especially male engineers, no offense my friends) has taught me that feelings have no place in solving a problem, rather they get in the way. Unfortunately (?), that makes sense. No one can afford to be emotional about a safety valve or a P&ID. It's insanity, weakness. 

And yet...there is my "human" side. The side that loves living, growing things. I liked Chemical Engineering, but I LOVED BioChemical Engineering-adding a biological process to the engineering of it all. I know the moods of my dog, incessantly check the temperature on my fish tank, cuddle my cats, and long for an herb garden. A wise friend of mine told me recently that she views her children as treasures, not projects, and that has made all the difference. Cold logic doesn't translate well to people, as much as I want it to sometimes. Especially because we act based on a complex mix of logic, emotion, and culture that typically we don't even understand.

Pastor Leon in Pine Ridge was someone who I felt saw me as I am..this halfbreed of engineer and human. (he's not the only one...thanks Mom!) Instead of feeling trapped between two worlds, he helped me see my value as a "translator", almost a go-between or ambassador. Spock was the same way (see, I'm showing my Techie/Trekkie side!), a product of two worlds and able to use that for a greater good. Instead of feeling like a weak/emotional engineer OR an unfeeling counselor, incapable in either capacity, I'll hope to harness my strengths in both areas and become Spock. With a better sense of humor.
