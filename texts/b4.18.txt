I just want the people I care about to come back to me. I'm so tired of having to maintain all of the friendships in my life. Why do I always have to be the one to chase you around? If we really are friends why don't you initiate some conversation? Where is the effort.

I'm just so tired, and so lackluster.

A couple of weeks ago I was feeling suicidal; it's passed now but it's always a scary feeling.

I have this critical voice in my head, and it is always telling me I'm lazy and not good enough. I'm even starting to worry about getting older and looking older. I'm worried that my most attractive years are already behind me and I still wasn't good enough then. 

I've lost almost all of my self-confidence. I used to think I was pretty but now I slouch around. I don't feel pretty. I feel like a washed up fat hag. Awful stuff to write. It's like all of the insecurities of 16 have come flooding back to me. I hate it.

I feel like I always have to work at relationships because I am unlikable or undesirable and people don't want to be around me. It is likely a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I just feel awful right now.
I just don't know.
