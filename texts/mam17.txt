Thank you, Goddess of Coffee Beans, for providing the Way to Wakefulness and Alertness. Your liquid love reminds us that the Divine is everywhere.

I'm doing a little better today. Yesterday was good because I saw kids. I need to drum up some business so I can keep working with this population.

Its going to be hot! It was already 74 at 7am and getting hotter by the minute and the smoke from the still burning fire (250 sq miles; 77% contained) in the mountains has bothered my sinuses. I'm missing fall weather from more northern climates; crispy, clear. Cold weather has a way of reminding me that I'm alive; hot weather makes me want to find a cave and wait it out.

Okay, its time to wake Gwen up and start the day. She's having a great start at school with friends and even classwork--she's bragging that she has to write a 700 word essay on anything. I'm feeling peaceful about the year's prospect--school is so stressful for me!

Yea! They may be bringing in the Shuttle here at Edwards this evening. I love the multiple sonic booms as it comes down. I'll email Frank and see if he can get the info on when it'll come in and take Gwen up to see it. We haven't done that.
