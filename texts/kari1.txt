t-pain is still rockin


Playlist:
Madeline Adams - White Flat
The Lucksmiths - First Frost
Royksopp - Junior
T-Pain - THR33 RINGZ (such a gay name for such a good album)
Spangle call Lilli line - PURPLE

amazingly these are all albums that've come out in the past 6 months (i think T-Pain's is pushing it though)
