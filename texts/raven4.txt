So, we got a call early this morning from Bryan's friend because he was having to get a new screen for him computer and he wanted Bryan's opinion. While there was saw a very good laptop for a decent price. So i got it and i SHOULD finally be able to play games. It is a VERY different set up from my last one though. It's going to take me a LONG while to get used to it. lol. PRETTY!
