I wrote a list recently, it was inspired by something going around facebook, "15 things you should stop doing to yourself" I wasn't completely impressed by facebooks list so I created one that was more personal to me.
One was in fact not to procrastinate and here I am on live journal 9am writing about a list not to procrastinate while I'm procrastinating about sed list
I love to write though so I suppose it all balances out in the end.
I love being creative its like it has always been a deep urge within me from such a young age, it can sadden me to think that maybe it stems from having such a vivid imagination to escape my imagination but regardless I feel as if its a very powerful tool, that I realize not everyone can wield, Just the same as me not being able to do complex maths or having a terrible memory and other people excelling at those things.
I excel as a creative producer, its been a hard journey of acceptance, I was always laughed at and under-rated by my family for not being clever, there are several memories from my childhood where I was dismissed or my thoughts disregarded.

Amongst these though are moments where I knew I was different, in infants about aged 6 we were given a phone to colour in and stick into our books, not only did I do this but I cut the receiver off the the top and drew in a phone cord to attached the two stuck down teachers, I remember my teacher being so impressed with me she told me to go round to the other classes to show other teachers.
I know it seems like such a simple thing but those where the moments that meant so much to me, having someone see me excel at a last and rewarding it.

My mother wasn't always so insane there are times when I can remember her being just as creative as I am, then why didn't she ever encourage me? why did she look at me the way she did with , maybe she never wanted me to be like her?

Undoubtedly I am though but her bests bit she can leave her crazy as far away from me as possible!
